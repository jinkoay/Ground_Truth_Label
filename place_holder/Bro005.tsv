Summary of experiments since, well, since last week and also since the -	1
Oh. O_K.	0
we've started to  run  - work on this.	1
Um.  So since last week we've started to fill the column with um	1
uh features	1
w- with nets trained on P_L_P	1
with on-line normalization but with delta also, because the column was not completely - well, it's still not completely filled, but	1
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	0
we have more results to compare with network using without P_L_P and	1
finally, hhh,  um  ehhh   P_L- uh delta seems very important.	1
Uh  I don't know. If you take um,	0
let's say,	0
anyway  Aurora-two-B_,	0
so, the next - t- the second, uh, part of the table,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh  when we use the large training set using French, Spanish, and English,	1
you have one hundred and six	1
Mm-hmm.	0
without delta and eighty-nine with the delta.	1
a- And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being, uh, the baseline performance, but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the H_T_K? Yes.	1
Yeah, on the baseline, yeah.	1
So -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much  uh	0
uh	0
much smaller	0
It's out of the way.	0
um -	0
Right.	0
But,	1
actually, um,	1
for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages.	1
And	0
Mmm,  Yeah.	0
And f- also for Italian, actually.	0
If you take the second	0
set of experiment for Italian, so, the mismatched condition,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um	0
when we use the training on TIMIT	1
so, it's multi-English, we have a ninety-one number,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
and training with other languages is a little bit worse.	1
Um -	0
Oh,  I  see. Down near the bottom of this sheet.	0
Uh,   yes.	0
So, yeah.	0
O_K.	0
And, yeah, and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta.	1
If y- if I take the training s- the large training set, it's - we have one hundred and seventy-two,	1
Yes.	0
Yeah.	0
and one hundred and four when we use delta.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh.	1
Even if the contexts used is quite the same, because without delta we use  seventeenths - seventeen  frames.	1
Uh.	0
Yeah, um, so the second point is that we have no single cross-language experiments,	0
uh, that we did not have last week.	0
Uh, so this is	0
training the net on French	0

T_I-digits.	0

yeah.	0
What we see is that	0
these nets are not as good, except for the multi-English, which is always one of the best.	1
Yeah, then we started to work	1
on a large dat- database containing,	1
uh, sentences from the French, from the Spanish, from the TIMIT, from SPINE,	1

uh English digits, and from Italian digits.	1

for the ne - rest of experiment I use multi-English,	1

So, um	0
uh, well, I don't think this is a bug but this - this is something in - probably in the M_S_G	0

I don't know what exactly. Perhaps the fact that the - the -	1
there's no low-pass filter, well, or no pre-emp- pre-emphasis filter and that	1
there is some D_C offset in the Italian, or, well, something simple like that.	1
But - that we need to sort out if want to	1

as Carmen said, if we combine the two, we have the result, basically, of P_L_P.	0

Um,	0
one qu- thing is that, uh - I think I asked you this before, but I wanna double check. When you say	0

maybe	0
tha- this can help.	0
Perhaps, yeah.	0
Well, that's - that's  one  thing, but see the  other  thing is that, um, I mean it's good to take the difficult  case,  but let's - let's consider what that  means.	0
What - what we're saying is that one o- one of the things that - I mean  my  interpretation of your - your s- original suggestion is something like this, as  motivation.	1
When we train on  data  that is in  one  sense or  another,	1
similar  to the  testing  data,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
then we get a  win  by having  discriminant    training.	1
When we train on something that's quite  different,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
we have a potential to have some  problems.	1
And, um,  if  we get something that  helps  us when it's somewhat  similar,	0
and doesn't  hurt  us too  much  when it - when it's quite different,	0
Yeah.	0
that's maybe not so  bad.	0
So the question is, if you took the  same  combination,	0
Mmm.	0
and you tried it out on, uh - on say  digits,	0
On T_I-digits? O_K. Yeah.	0
you know, d- Was that experiment done?	0
No, not yet.	0
Yeah, O_K.	0
Uh, then does that,	0
eh - you know maybe with similar  noise  conditions and so forth,	0
does it - does it then look much  better?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh - of tests?	0
So, an-  anyway.	0
O_K, go ahead.	0
Yeah. Mm-hmm.	0
And, with this type of configuration which I do on experiment	0
using the new neural net	0
with name  broad klatt  s- twenty-seven, uh, d- I have found more or less the same result.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So, it's	0
Little bit better?	0
slightly  better, yeah.	0
Slightly  better.	0
Yeah.	0
Slightly bet- better. Yes, is better.	0
And - and you know again maybe if you use the, uh, delta	0
Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Maybe.	0
there, uh, you would bring it up to where it was, uh you know at  least  about the  same  for a difficult  case.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, yeah.	0
So.	0
Well, so perhaps let's - let's jump at the last experiment. It's	0
Yeah.	0
either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output.	0
i-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
It's again better. So it's eighty-nine point - point one.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah,	0
and we have only forty - forty feature	0
So.	0
because in this situation we have one hundred and three	0
feature.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
And then w- with the  first  configuration, I f-	0
Yeah.	0
I am found that	0
work,	0
uh, doesn't work -	0
uh, well,	0
work,  but is better, the second configuration.	0
Because I - for the del- Engli- P_L_P delta and delta-delta,	0
here I have eighty-five point three  accuracy,   and	0
with the second configuration I have eighty-seven point one.	0
Um, by the way, there is a- another, uh, suggestion that would apply, uh, to the second configuration,	0
um, which, uh, was made, uh, by, uh, Hari.	0
And that was that, um, if you have - uh feed two streams into H_T_K,	0
um, and you, uh, change the, uh  variances  -	0
if you scale the variances associated with, uh these streams	0
um, you can effectively  scale   the streams.	0
Right? So, um,	0
Mmm.	0
you know, without  changing  the  scripts  for H_T_K, which is the rule here,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh, you can still  change  the  variances  which would effectively change the scale of these - these, uh, two  streams  that come in.	0
Uh,  yeah.	0
And, um,	0
so,	0
um, if you  do  that,	0
for instance it may be the case	0
that, um,	0
the M_L_P should not be considered as strongly,	0
for instance.	0
Mmm.	0
And, um, so this is just setting them to be,	0
excuse me,  of equal - equal weight.	0
Maybe it  shouldn't  be equal weight.	0
Maybe.	0
Right?  You know, I- I'm sorry to say that gives  more  experiments if we wanted to  look  at that, but -	0
but, uh, um, you know on the other hand it's just experiments at the level of the H_T_K  recognition.  It's not even the H_T_K, uh,	0
Mmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
uh - Well, I guess you have to do the H_T_K training also. Uh,  do  you?	0
Yeah.	0
so this is what we  decided to do.	0
Let me think.	0
Maybe you  don't.	0
Uh.	0
Yeah, you have to change the -	0
No, you can just do it in - as - once you've done the training -	0
And then you can vary it. Yeah.	0
Yeah, the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could -	0
you  could just  scale  them all.	0
Scale the - ?	0
Variances.	0
Yeah.	0
But -	0
Is it - i- th- I mean the H_T_K models are diagonal  covariances,  so I d-	0
That's uh, exactly the  point,  I think, that if you change -	0
Is it -	0
um,	0
Hmm.	0
change what they  are  -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
It's diagonal  covariance  matrices, but you	0
say what those  variances  are.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So,	0
that - you know, it's  diagonal,  but the  diagonal  means th- that then you're gonna - it's gonna - it's gonna internally multiply it - and - and uh,	0
uh, i- it im- uh  implicitly   exponentiated  to get  probabilities,  and so it's - it's gonna -	0
Mmm.	0
it's - it's going to affect the  range  of things if you change the - change the  variances   of some of the features.	0
Mmm.	0
do?	0
So, i- it's  precisely  given that model you can very  simply  affect, uh, the s- the  strength  that you apply the  features.	0
That was - that was, uh, Hari's suggestion.	0
Yeah. Yeah.	0
So, um -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
So.  So it could just be that h- treating them equally, tea- treating two streams equally is just - just not the right thing to do.	0
Of course it's potentially opening a can of worms because,	0
you know, maybe it should be a different	0
number for - for each  kind of  test set, or something, but -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah .	0
So I guess the other thing is to take -	1
you know - if one were to take, uh, you know, a couple of the most successful of these,	1
Yeah, and test across everything.	1
and uh -	0
Yeah, try all these different tests.	1
Mmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Alright. Uh.	0
So, the next point, yeah,	0
we've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn,	0
um, about their um,	0
uh, articulatory stuff,	0
um.	0
So we'll perhaps start something next week.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um, discussion with Hynek, Sunil and Pratibha for	1
trying to plug in their	1
our -	1
our networks with their - within their block diagram,	1
uh,  where  to plug in the - the network, uh,	1
after the - the feature, before as um	1
a- as a plugin or as a- anoth- another path,	1
discussion about multi-band and TRAPS,	0
um, actually Hynek would like to see,	1
perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is,	1
uh, temporal L_D_A followed b- by a spectral L_D_A	1
for each uh critical band.	1
And he would like to replace these by a network	1
which would, uh, make the system look like a TRAP.	1
Well,	0
basically, it would be a TRAP system.	0
Basically, this is a TRAP system -	0
kind of TRAP system, I mean, but	0
where the neural network are replaced by L_D_A.	0
Hmm.	0
Um,	0
yeah, and about multi-band,	0
uh, I started multi-band M_L_P trainings,	1
um	0
mmh	0
Actually, I w- I w- hhh  prefer to do exactly what I did	0
when I was in Belgium.	0
So I take exactly the same	1
configurations, seven bands with nine frames of context,	1
and we just train on TIMIT,	1
and on the large database,	1
so, with SPINE and everything.	1
And, mmm,	0
I'm starting to train also, networks with	1
larger contexts.	1
So, this would - would be something between TRAPS and multi-band because	1
we still have quite large bands,	1
and - but with a lot of context also.	1
So	0
Um	0
Yeah, we still have to work on Finnish,	1
um,	1
basically, to make a decision on which M_L_P	1
can be the best across the different languages.	1
For the moment it's the TIMIT network,	1
and perhaps	1
the network trained on  everything.	1
So.	0
Now we can test these two networks on -	0
with - with delta and	0
large networks.	0
Well, test them also on Finnish and see	0
Mmm.	0
which one is the - the -	0
the best.	0
Uh, well, the next part of the document is, well, basically, a kind of summary of what - everything that has been done. So.	1
We have seventy-nine M_L_Ps	1
trained on	1
one, two, three, four, uh, three, four, five,  six, seven	1
ten - on ten different databases.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh,	0
the number of frames is  bad  also, so we have one million and a half	0
for some, three million for other, and six million for the last one.	0
Uh, yeah!	1
As we mentioned, TIMIT is the only	1
that's hand-labeled,	1
and perhaps this is what makes the difference.	1
Um.	0
Yeah, the other are just Viterbi-aligned.	1
So these seventy-nine M_L_P differ on different things. First,	0
um with respect to the on-line normalization,	0
there are -	0
that use bad on-line normalization,	0
and other good on-line normalization.	0
Um.	0
With respect to the features,	0
with respect to the use of delta or no,	0
uh with respect to the hidden layer size	0
and to the targets.	0
Uh, but of course we don't have all the combination of these	0
different parameters	0
Um.	0
s-	0
What's this?	0
We only have two hundred eighty six  different  tests	0
Ugh!	0
And no- not two thousand.	0
I was impressed boy, two thousand.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
Ah, yes.	0
I say this morning that  @@  thought it was the -	0
Alright, now I'm just slightly impressed, O_K.	0
Um.	0
Yeah, basically the observation is what we discussed already.	1
The M_S_G problem,	1
um,	0
the fact that the M_L_P trained on target task decreased the error rate.	1
but	1
when the M_- M_L_P is trained on the um -	1
is not trained on the target task, it increased the error rate compared to using straight features.	1
Except if the features are bad -	0
uh, actually except if	0
the features are not correctly on-line normalized.	0
In this case	0
the tandem is still better even if it's trained on - not on the target digits.	0
Yeah. So it sounds like  yeah, the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization.	0
Yeah.	0
But if you can do good normalization it's -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
it's uh -	0
Uh, so the fourth point is, yeah,	1
O_K.	0
the TIMIT	0
plus noise seems to be	1
the training set that gives better -	1
So	0
the best network.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
So- Let me -	0
bef- before you go on to  the  possible issues. So,	1
on the M_S_G uh problem	1
um,	1
I think that in - in the -	1
um,	1
in the short  time  solution	1
um,	1
that is,	1
um,	1
trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
uh, much as I said with J_RASTA, even though I really like J_RASTA and I really like M_S_G,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I think it's kind of in category that it's, it - it may be complicated.	1
Yeah.	0
And uh it might be - if someone's  interested  in it, uh, certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term,	1
once we get out of this particular rush  uh for results. But in the  short  term, unless you have some - some s- strong idea of what's wrong,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
I don't know at all but	0
uh -	0
I've -	0
perhaps - I have the feeling that it's something that's quite -	0
quite simple or	0
Yeah, probably.	0
just like nnn,	0
no high-pass filter or -	0
Mmm.	0
Yeah.  My - But I don't know.	0
There's supposed to - well M_S_G is supposed to have a- an on-line normalization though, right?	0
It's -	0
There is, yeah, an A_G_C- kind of A_G_C.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, but also there's an on-line norm- besides the A_G_C, there's an on-line normalization that's supposed to be uh,	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
yeah,	0
Mmm.	0
taking out means and variances and so forth. So.	0
Yeah.	0
In fac- in fact the on-line normalization that we're using  came  from the M_S_G design, so it's -	0
Um.	0
Yeah, but -	0
Yeah.	0
But this was the  bad  on-line normalization.	0
Actually.	0
Uh. Are your results are still with the bad - the bad -	0

"On-line-two" is good.	0

uh, i- if - if uh someone, you know,	0
uh, wants to play with it for a little bit. I mean,	0
you're gonna do what you're gonna do but -	1
Mmm.	0

Uh.	0
And the other - the results uh, observations two and three,	0
Mmm.	0
Um, is uh -	0
Yeah, that's pretty much what we've seen. That's - that - what we were concerned about is that if it's not on the target task -	1
If it's  on  the target task then it - it - it helps	1
to have the M_L_P transforming it.	1
Mmm.	0
If it uh - if it's  not  on the target task,	1
then, depending on how  different  it is,	1
uh you can get uh, a reduction in performance.	1
Mmm.	0
And the question is now how to -	0
how to get one and not the other? Or how to - how to ameliorate	0
the - the problems.	0
Mmm.	0
Um, because it - it certainly does - is nice to have in there, when it -  when there  is  something  like  the	0
Mm-hmm.	0

the e- e- But this is still not clear because,	1

I - I - I don't think we have enough result to	1

So you're saying that um,	0
um, although	0
from what we  see,  yes there's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency. That is,	1
uh, when the neural net is trained on	1
one of those and tested on something different, we don't do as well as in the target thing. But you're saying	1
Mm-hmm.	0
that uh, it is -	0

putting all the noise that we can find inside a database.	0
Mm-hmm.	0

So maybe the  analogy  isn't quite right.	0
You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved. You had reverb- for a single variable which was re- uh, uh, reverberation.	0
Here  the problem seems to be is that we  don't  have	1
a hug- a  really  huge net	1
with a really  huge  amount of training data.	1
But we have s- f-  for this kind of task, I would think,  sort of a  modest  amount. I mean, a million frames actually isn't that  much.	1
We have a  modest  amount of - of uh training data	1
from a  couple  different  conditions,	1
and then uh - in - yeah, that -	1
and the  real  situation is that there's  enormous  variability	1
that we anticipate in the test set	1
in terms of  language,  and  noise  type  uh, and uh,  uh, channel characteristic,	1
sort of all over the map. A bunch of different dimensions.	0
And so, I'm just concerned that	0
we don't really have  um,	0
the data to train up - I mean	0
one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in -	0
we still don't have a good	0
explanation  for this,  but	0
we are  seeing  that we're adding in uh, a fe- few different databases	0
and uh the performance is getting  worse	0
and uh,	0
when we just take  one  of those databases that's a pretty  good  one, it actually is - is - is - is - is  better.	0
And uh that says to me, yes, that, you know, there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we're adding in or something like that. But one way or another  we don't have	0
uh, seemingly, the ability  to  represent,  in the neural net of the size that we have,	0
um, all of the  variability   that we're gonna be  covering.	0
So that I'm - I'm - I'm  hoping  that um,	0
this is another take on the  efficiency  argument you're making,  which  is  I'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets,	0
uh, that uh if we - if they look at	0
more constrained conditions they - they'll have enough parameters to really  represent  them.	0
I think the way that Hynek or - or Malik had - had told me was that if you try to train a classifier	0
on too much - too many conditions then it'll do good on  none  of them,	0
but it'll start doing something  else.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Which means, if you have something	0
Mm-hmm.	0
else  in there it'll be nicer  @@  I'm not sure  @@	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I also have some - some - a new theory on why	0
um LogRASTA-P_L_P - uh P_L_P  with on-line normalization might be	0
a little bit better than LogRASTA-P_L_P with on-line normalization.	0
It has to do with  certain  distribution characteristics.	0
But if you take away the on-line normalization, LogRASTA seems to do better than P_L_P  but not in all  cases.	0
Yeah.	0
So doing both is - is not - is not right, you mean, or - ?	0
Um.	0
not so much not right, but it if you throw in the on-line normalization then it might not be necessary to use the LogRASTA-P_L_P.	0
