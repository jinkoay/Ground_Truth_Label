Oh. O_K.	0
we've started to  run  - work on this.	0
Um.  So since last week we've started to fill the column with um	0
uh features	0
w- [MASK]	0
with on-line normalization but with delta also, because the column was not completely - well, it's still not completely filled, but	0
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	0
we have more results to [MASK]and	0
finally, hhh,  um  ehhh   P_L- uh delta seems very important.	0
Uh  I don't know. If you take um,	0
let's say,	0
[MASK]	0
so, the next - t- the second, uh, part of the table,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh  when we use the large training set using French, Spanish, and English,	0
you have one hundred and six	0
Mm-hmm.	0
[MASK]	0
a- And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being, uh, the baseline performance, but [MASK] Yes.	0
Yeah, on the baseline, yeah.	0
So -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much  uh	0
uh	0
much smaller	0
It's out of the way.	0
um -	0
Right.	0
But,	0
actually, um,	0
for [MASK]	0
And	0
Mmm,  Yeah.	0
And f- also for Italian, actually.	0
If you take the second	0
set of experiment for Italian, so, the mismatched condition,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um	0
when [MASK]	0
so, it's multi-English, we have a ninety-one number,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and training with other languages is a little bit worse.	0
Um -	0
Oh,  I  see. Down near the bottom of this sheet.	0
Uh,   yes.	0
So, yeah.	0
O_K.	0
And, yeah, and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta.	0
If y- if I take the training s- the large training set, it's - we have one hundred and seventy-two,	0
Yes.	0
Yeah.	0
and one hundred and four when we use delta.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh.	0
Even if the contexts used is quite the same, because without delta we use  seventeenths - seventeen  frames.	0
Uh.	0
Yeah, um, so the second point is that we have no single cross-language experiments,	0
uh, that we did not have last week.	0
Uh, so this is	0
training the net on French	0
only, or on English only, and testing on Italian.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on,	0
uh	0
T_I-digits.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And, fff  um,	0
yeah.	0
What we see is that	0
these nets are not as good, [MASK] which is always one of the best.	0
Yeah, then we started to work	0
on a large dat- database containing,	0

Yes, yeah, I mean it can't be compared with the  other  cuz this is, uh - with multi-English, uh, training. So you have to compare it with the one  over  that you've got in a  box,  which is that, uh the eighty-four point six.	0

I don't know - but maybe if we have the neural network  [MASK]	0
maybe	0
tha- this can help.	0
Perhaps, yeah.	0
Well, that's - that's  one  thing, but see the  other  thing is that, um, I mean it's good to take the difficult  case,  but let's - let's consider what that  means.	0
What - what we're saying is that one o- one of the things that - I mean  my  interpretation of your - your s- original suggestion is something like this, as  motivation.	1
When we train on  data  that is in  one  sense or  another,	1
similar  to the  testing  data,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
then we get a  win  by having  discriminant    training.	1
When we train on something that's quite  different,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
we have a potential to have some  problems.	1
And, um,  if  we get something that  helps  us when it's somewhat  similar,	0
and doesn't  hurt  us too  much  when it - when it's quite different,	0
Yeah.	0
that's maybe not so  bad.	0
So the question is, if you took the  same  combination,	0
Mmm.	0
and you tried it out on, uh - on say  digits,	0
[MASK]	0
you know, d- Was that experiment done?	0
No, not yet.	0
Yeah, O_K.	0
Uh, then does that,	0
eh - you know maybe with similar  noise  conditions and so forth,	0
does it - does it then look much  better?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh - of tests?	0
So, an-  anyway.	0
O_K, go ahead.	0
Yeah. Mm-hmm.	0
And, with this type of configuration which I do on experiment	0
using the new neural net	0
with name  broad klatt  s- twenty-seven, uh, d- I have found more or less the same result.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So, it's	0
Little bit better?	0
slightly  better, yeah.	0
Slightly  better.	0
Yeah.	0
Slightly bet- better. Yes, is better.	0
And - and you know again maybe if you use the, uh, delta	0
Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Maybe.	0
there, uh, you would bring it up to where it was, uh you know at  least  about the  same  for a difficult  case.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, yeah.	0
So.	0
Well, so perhaps let's - let's jump at the last experiment. It's	1
Yeah.	0
either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output.	1
i-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
It's again better. So it's eighty-nine point - point one.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah,	0
and we have only forty - forty feature	0
So.	1
because in this situation we have one hundred and three	0
feature.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
And then w- with the  first  configuration, I f-	0
Yeah.	0
I am found that	0
work,	0
uh, doesn't work -	0
uh, well,	0
work,  but is better, the second configuration.	0
Because I - for the del- Engli- [MASK]	0
here I have eighty-five point three  accuracy,   and	0
with the second configuration I have eighty-seven point one.	0
Um, by the way, there is a- another, uh, suggestion that would apply, uh, to the second configuration,	0
um, which, uh, was made, uh, by, uh, Hari.	0
And that was that, um, if you have - [MASK]	0
um, and you, uh, change the, uh  variances  -	0
if you scale the variances associated with, uh these streams	0
um, you can effectively  scale   the streams.	0
Right? So, um,	0
Mmm.	0
you know, without  changing [MASK] which is the rule here,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh, you can still  change  the  variances  which would effectively change the scale of these - these, uh, two  streams  that come in.	0
Uh,  yeah.	0
And, um,	0
so,	0
um, if you  do  that,	0
for instance it may be the case	0
that, um,	0
[MASK]	0
for instance.	0
Mmm.	0
And, um, so this is just setting them to be,	0
excuse me,  of equal - equal weight.	0
Maybe it  shouldn't  be equal weight.	0
Maybe.	0
Right?  You know, I- I'm sorry to say that gives  more  experiments if we wanted to  look  at that, but -	0
but, uh, um, you know on the other hand it's just experiments at [MASK]	0
Mmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
uh - Well, [MASK] Uh,  do  you?	0
Yeah.	0
so this is what we  decided to do.	0
Let me think.	0
Maybe you  don't.	0
Uh.	0
Yeah, you have to change the -	0
No, you can just do it in - as - once you've done the training -	0
And then you can vary it. Yeah.	0
Yeah, the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could -	0
you  could just  scale  them all.	0
Scale the - ?	0
Variances.	0
Yeah.	0
But -	0
Is it - i- th- [MASK]  so I d-	1
That's uh, exactly the  point,  I think, that if you change -	0
Is it -	1
um,	0
Hmm.	0
change what they  are  -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
It's diagonal  covariance  matrices, but you	0
say what those  variances  are.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So,	0
that - you know, it's  diagonal,  but the  diagonal  means th- that then you're gonna - it's gonna - it's gonna internally multiply it - and - and uh,	0
uh, i- it im- uh  implicitly   exponentiated  to get  probabilities,  and so it's - it's gonna -	0
Mmm.	0
it's - it's going to affect the  range  of things if you change the - change the  variances   of some of the features.	0
Mmm.	1
do?	0
So, i- it's  precisely  given that model you can very  simply  affect, uh, the s- the  strength  that you apply the  features.	0
That was - that was, uh, Hari's suggestion.	0
Yeah. Yeah.	0
So, um -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
So.  So it could just be that h- treating them equally, tea- treating two streams equally is just - just not the right thing to do.	0
Of course it's potentially opening a can of worms because,	1
you know, maybe it should be a different	0
number for - for each  kind of  test set, or something, but -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah .	0
So I guess the other thing is to take -	1
you know - if one were to take, uh, you know, a couple of the most successful of these,	1
Yeah, and test across everything.	1
and uh -	0
Yeah, try all these different tests.	1
Mmm.	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Alright. Uh.	0
So, the next point, yeah,	0
we've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn,	0
um, about their um,	0
uh, articulatory stuff,	0
um.	0

uh,  where  to plug in the - the network, uh,	1

um, [MASK]	1

uh, [MASK]	1
um	0

when I was in Belgium.	0
So I take exactly the same	1
configurations, seven bands with nine frames of context,	1
and [MASK]	1
and on the large database,	1
so, with SPINE and everything.	1
And, mmm,	0
I'm starting to train also, networks with	1
larger contexts.	1
So, this would - [MASK]	1
we still have quite large bands,	1
and - but with a lot of context also.	1
So	0
Um	0
Yeah, we still have to work on Finnish,	1
um,	1
basically, [MASK]	0
can be the best across the different languages.	1
For [MASK]	0

So.	0
Now we can test these two networks on -	0

trained on	1

ten - on ten different databases.	1
Mm-hmm.	0

the number of frames is  bad  also, so we have one million and a half	0
for some, three million for other, and six million for the last one.	0
Uh, yeah!	1
[MASK]	0
that's hand-labeled,	1
and perhaps this is what makes the difference.	1
Um.	0
Yeah, [MASK]	1
So [MASK] First,	0
um with respect to the on-line normalization,	0
there are -	0
that use bad on-line normalization,	0
and other good on-line normalization.	0
Um.	0
With respect to the features,	0
with respect to the use of delta or no,	0
uh with respect to the hidden layer size	0
and to the targets.	0
Uh, but of course we don't have all the combination of these	0
different parameters	0
Um.	0
s-	0
What's this?	0
We only have two hundred eighty six  different  tests	0

[MASK] decreased the error rate.	1
but	1
when [MASK] on the um -	0

Except if the features are bad -	0
uh, actually except if	0
the features are not correctly on-line normalized.	0
In this case	0
the tandem is still better even if it's trained on - not on the target digits.	0
Yeah. So it sounds like  yeah, the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization.	0
Yeah.	0
But if you can do good normalization it's -	0

uh, seemingly, the ability  to  represent,  in the neural net of the size that we have,	0
um, all of the  variability   that we're gonna be  covering.	0
