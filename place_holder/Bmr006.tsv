O_K, now we're on and it seems to be working.	0
One two three four five six	0
It's like when it's been sitting for a long time or something.	0
I don't know  what  it is.	0
But all all I know is that it seems like every time I	0
am up here  after  a meeting,	0
And if I'm up here and I start it and we're all sitting here waiting to have a  meeting,  it	0
gives me that  error  message and I have not yet sat down with -	0
been able to get that  error  message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it's occurring in the  code.	0
Next time you get it maybe we should write it down.	0
Was it a pause, or ?	0
O_K. Was it on "pause"	0
So uh so the uh,	0
the new procedural change that just got suggested, which I think is a good idea is that um,	0
we do the digit recordings at the  end.	0
And that way, if we're recording somebody else's uh meeting,	0
and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time,	0
uh, then they can run off.	0
It'll mean we'll get somewhat fewer	0
uh, sets of digits, but um, I think that way we'll	0
cut into people's time, um,	0
if someone's on strict time	0
So, I th- I think I think we should start doing that.	0
so, uh, let's see, we were having a discussion the other day,	1
maybe we should bring that up,	1
about uh, the nature of the data that we are collecting.	1
that uh, we should have a fair amount of data that is	1
um, collected for the same meeting,	1
so that we can, uh -	1
I don't know. Wh- what what were some of the points again about that?	0
Uh, well, O_K, I'll back up.  Um, at the previous at last week's meeting,  this  meeting	0
about wanting to get more data and I I talked about this with Jane and	0
Adam, um, and was thinking of	1
this mostly just so that we could do research	1
um, since we'll have a new this new student di- does wanna work with us,  th- the guy that was at the last meeting.	1
And he's already funded part-time, so we'll only be paying him for sort of for  half  of the normal part-time,	0
And what's he interested in, specifically?	0
he's comes from a signal-processing background, but I liked him a lot cuz he's very interested in	1
higher  level things, like language, and	1
disfluencies and all kinds of eb-	1
maybe prosody,  so he's just getting his feet wet in that.	1
Anyway, I thought O_K, maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts -	0
that we'd have, you know, enough data to work with.	0
But, um, Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that	0
just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m- you need to make sure that the speakers	0
are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want, and so forth.	0
So, I thought about that and I think it's still possible, um,	1
but I'd rather try to get more regular meetings of	1
types that we know about,  and hear , then sort of a	1
mish-mosh of a bunch of one -	1
Yeah, just because it would be very hard to	0
process the data in all senses, both	0
to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it, like	0
well, I was talking to Morgan about	0
things like summarization, or what's this meeting about.	0
it's very different if you have a group that's just	0
giving a report on what they did that week, versus coming to a decision and so forth. So.	1
Then I was um, talking to Morgan about some  new proposed work in this area,	1
sort of a  separate  issue from what the student would be working on	1
I was thinking of doing	1
some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues	1
numbers of overlaps and amount of speech,	1
from the interaction that can be measured from	1
the signals and from the diff-	1
sort of hot spots in the meeting, or things where stuff is going on that might be important	1
for someone who didn't attend to   listen  to.	1
uh, regard, I thought we definitely w- will need -	1
it'd b- it'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data	1
from a few different domains, or a few different kinds of meetings. So this this meeting is one of them, although I'm not sure I can participate if I -	1
You know, I would feel very strange being  part  of a meeting that you were then analyzing later for things like summarization.	0
Um, and then there are some others that menti- that Morgan mentioned, like the front-end meeting  and maybe a networking  group meeting.	1
Yeah, we're we're  hoping  that they'll let us start recording regularly. So.	0
So if that were the case then I think we'd have enough. But basically, for anything where you're trying to get	1
a summarization of some kind of meeting    meaning  out of the meeting, um,	0
it would be too hard to have	0
fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really	0
have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize, but -	1
different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries.	1
And then we need a couple that of  We don't wanna just have  one  group because that might be specific to that particular group, but	0
three or four different kinds.	0
Yeah, we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the	0
See, I've never listened to the data for the front-end  meeting.	0
Yeah, we we've only had  three.  So.	0
But maybe that's enough. So, in general, I was thinking more data but also	1
data where we hold some parameters	1
constant or fairly similar,  like a meeting about	1
of people doing a certain kind of	1
work where at least half the participants each time are the same.	1
Now, let l- l- let me just	0
give you the other side to that cuz I ca- because I I don't disagree with that,	0
but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too.	1
Uh, for  other  kinds of research,	1
particularly the  acoustic  oriented research,	1
I actually feel the opposite need.	1
I'd like to have lots of different people.	0
As many people here a- a- and talking about the kind of thing that	0
you were just talking about	0
it would have uh too few people from my point of view. I'd like to have many different speakers.	1
I think I would  also  very much like us to have a fair amount of  really  random scattered meetings, of somebody coming down from campus, and -	1
and uh, I mean, sure, if we can	1
get  more  from them, fine, but if we only get one or  two  from each group,	1
that  still  could be useful  acoustically  just because we'd have	1
Yeah, I definitely agree with that. Definitely.	0
close and distant microphones with different people.	1
Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers.	0
Because I think if you just say an- And in particular, my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because	0
there you'd have so- people who'd have proficiency enough in English that -	0
that uh, it would be useful for for purposes You know.	0
But you know, I think	0
I've been I've I I've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you'd get  such  a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you'd have at all.	0
Well, you want to i-	0
And and the English you'd have The language models would be really hard to build because it would not really be it would be an  interlanguage  rather than  than a -	0
O_K, uh, first place, I I I don't think we'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another, I think	0
there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I I think that's what we're	0
It has to be a -	1
a pre-existing meeting,  like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway. That's I think what we and I agree with.	1
I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors	1
uh, and and and uh, senior uh, uh, d- and	1
uh, doctoral students who are leading projects	1
that they have their hold their meeting down here.	1
Uh, that's the first point. The second point is	0
I think that for some time now, going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we've worked with who had non-native accents	0
Oh, oh. I'm not saying  accents.	0
and I th- I think that -	0
u- The accent's not the problem.	0
No, it's more a matter of uh,  proficiency,	0
e- e- just simply  fluency.	0
I mean, I deal with people	0
on on campus who -	0
undergraduates um in  computer  science	0
uh, have language skills that make, you know that their their fluency and writing skills	0
Oh! You're not talking about foreign language at  all.  You're just talking about -	0
Yeah. Yeah, just talking about.	0
Well, e- I just think, but you know, it's like when you get into the graduate level,	0
We all had the same thought.	0
I mean, I'm not saying accents. I'm say- I'm saying fluency. Well, yeah.	0
Yeah, then we're  completely  gone. It's -	0
The the habits are already burnt in. But -	0
Well, I think that, um -	1
I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English.	1
if it's a pre-existing meeting and it's held in English,	0
I I think it's probably O_K if a few of the people don't have	0
uh, g-  particularly  good English skills.	0
O_K, now can I can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that	0
um, there's there's this this issue, you have a corpus out there, it should be used for for multiple things cuz it's so expensive to put together.	0
And if people want to approach -	0
Um, i- so I know  e- e-	0
You know this The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group,	0
but the idea of language models, which are fund- you know	0
generally speaking uh, you know, t- t- terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent	0
or an hour invested in preparing the data,	0
if you have a choice between people who are	0
pr- more proficient in -	0
i- more fluent, more more	0
close to being academic English, then it would seem to me to be a  good  thing.	0
I guess I- maybe Hmm.	0
Because otherwise y- you don't have the ability to have -	0
Uh, so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that's the worst possible case. If you have people who are using English as a as an interlanguage because they they don't -	1
uh, they can't speak in their  native  languages and -	1
really a match to any existing,	1
this is the  worst  case scenario.	0
Well, that's pretty much what you're going to have in the  networking  group.	0
because because they most the network group is almost entirely Germans and  Spaniards.	0
But the thing is, I think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that  And I'm not objecting to  accents.   I I'm I'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view, could we have a language model, a a grammar -	1
that um, wo- would be	0
a a  possibility.  So y- so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky's model, an-	0
and do some top-down stuff, it to help th- the bottom-up and merge the things or whatever,	0
um, I don't see that there's an argument -	0
I'm I what I think is that why not have the corpus, since it's so expensive to put together, uh, useful for the widest	1
things that people generally  use  corpora for and which are, you know, used in computational linguistics.	1
Which which includes both top-down and bottom-up.	0
O_K, well, i- i- let's let's see what we can get.	1
I mean, it it I think that if we're aiming at at uh, groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together,	1
and it's from the Berkeley campus, probably most of it	1
Exactly. And my point in m- in my note to Liz was	1
will be O_K, but -	1
I think that undergrads are an iff- iffy population.	1
I definitely agree with that, I mean, for this purpose.	0
Well, not to mention the fact that I would be	0
hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen, probably even an- anyone under twenty-one.	0
Well, age-ist.  The " eighteen " is because of the consent form.	0
We'd hafta get find their parent to sign for them.	0
I have a uh, um, question.  Well, Morgan, you were mentioning that Mari may not	1
use the k- equipment from I_B_M	1
if they found something else, cuz	1
They're they're yeah, they're d- they're uh -	0
assessing whether they should do that or y- do something else,	0
hopefully over the next few weeks.	0
Cuz I mean, one remote possibility is that	1
if we st- if we inherited that equipment, if she weren't using it, could we set up a room in the linguistics department?	1
I mean, there there may be a lot more or or in psych, or in comp- wherever, in another building	1
um, record people there. I think we'd have a better chance of -	1
I think we'd need a real motivated	0
partner to do that. We'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this.	0
But if there were such a I mean it's a remote possibility, then	0
um, you know, one of  us  could you know, go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here. So it's just a	0
Well, the other thing -	1
just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware.	0
Yeah, I mean the other thing that I was  hoping  to do in the  first  place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around. Uh.	1
Well, I know that space is really scarce on at least in C_S.	0
You know, to to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult.	0
But you may not need a  separate  room, you know, the idea is, if they have a  meeting  room	0
they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth, and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something -	0
Well, maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something. You know.	0
I I think it's not out of the question. Um.	0
Yeah, I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting.	0
But I I I think you need, uh, another portable  thing	0
a- another portable equipment to to do, eh, more e- easier the recording process, eh,  out  from ICSI.	0
Eh  and   probably.  I don't know. Eh, if you you want to to record, eh, a seminar or a class, eh, in the university, you you need -	0
It- it would be eh eh very difficult to to put,	0
eh, a lot of, eh, head phones eh in different people when	0
you have to to record only with, eh, this kind of, eh, d- device.	0
I think if we if we wanna just record with	0
the tabletop microphones, that's easy.	0
Right? That's  very  easy, but that's not the corpus that we're collecting.	0
Actually, that's a int- that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that's maybe worth repeating.	0
We realized that, um, when we were talking about this that, O_K, there's these different things that we want to do with it.	0
So, um, it's true that we wanna be selective in some ways, uh, the way that you were speaking about with, uh, not having an interlingua and uh, these other issues.	0
But on the other hand, it's not necessarily true that we need  all  of the corpus to satisfy  all  of it.	0
So, a- a- as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that's done with a small n- recorded with a small, uh, typ- number of types of meetings	0
But we can also have another part that's, uh, just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that's O_K too.	0
We realized in discussion that the other thing is,	1
what about this business of distant and close microphones?	1
I mean, we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way, that's why we  did  it.	1
For th- for these issues of summarization, a lot of these higher level things  you  don't  really   need  the distant microphone.	1
Right, I mean, I c- I think there's -	0
And you don't really need the  close  microphone, you mean.	1
Yea- yeah yeah, you actually don't really even need  any  fancy microphone.  You can use found data.	0
Which one did you mean?	0
You don't ne- it doesn't you just need  some  microphone,  somewhere.	0
You need  some  microphone, but I mean -	0
@@  You you  can.  You can use -	0
but I think that any  data that we spend a lot of effort  to collect,	1
you know, each person who's interested in I mean, we have a cou- we have a bunch of different, um, slants and perspectives on what it's useful for,	1
um, they need to be	1
taking charge of making sure they're getting enough of the kind of data that they want.	1
So in my case, um,	1
there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others.	1
Not enough for others, right.	0
And so  I'm looking and thinking, "Well I'd be  glad  to	0
walk over and record people and so  forth if it's -	0
to help th- in my interest."	1
And other people need to do that for themselves, uh, h-	1
or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal -	1
But I think that I'm raising that cuz I think it's relevant  exactly  for this idea up there that if you think about, "Well, gee, we have this really complicated setup to do," well maybe you  don't.	0
Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that's good enough to get a -	0
Yeah. For some of it.	0
uh, a transcription from later,	0
you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording.	0
I mean, we we could have a fairly We could just get a DAT machine and -	0
Well, I agree with  Jane, though, on the other hand that -	0
So that might be true, you may say for instance, summarization, or something that	0
sounds very language oriented. You may say well,	0
"Oh yeah, you just do that from transcripts of a radio show." I mean, you don't even need the speech signal.    But	0
what you what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is	0
to be able to pick up on	0
Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to	0
be able to  determine  this. There's lots of cues you're not gonna have.	1
I   do  think that long term you should always try to	1
satisfy the greatest number of -	1
of interests and have this parallel information, which is really what makes this	1
Otherwise, you know, lots of other sites can propose -	0
I I I agree. Uh	1
but I I think that	1
We can't really underestimate the difficulty -	1
shouldn't  really u- underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up.	1
And so, uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say, "Oh, we'll just  do  it up there," -	1
If you're talking about something  simple,  where you throw away a lot of these dimensions, then you can do that right away.	1
Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here,	0
it  won't  happen quickly, it won't be easy, and there's all sorts of issues about th- you know	0
keeping the equipment safe, or else hauling it around, and all sorts of o-	0
try to bring people  here.	0
I think the  first  priority should be to pry  to get try to get people to come here.	1
I mean, that's that's -	0
We're set up for it.	0
The room is is really, uh, underused.	0
I thought the free lunch idea was a  great  idea.	0
Yeah, I thought so too.	0
Yeah, I And I think we can get people to come here, that -	0
But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of	1
your time  and the overhead in bringing people down.	0
Well, it would be  lunch afterwards. Right.	0
Well, I was thinking, lunch after.	0
And they'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert.	0
Yeah, they have to do their digits or they don't  get they don't  get their food.	0
Um, I had a I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered.	1
So. They they originally -	0
They've decided not to do go into speech.	0
So I'm not sure whether they'll still be so willing to volunteer, but I'll send an email and ask. I'll tell them about the free lunch. And they'll say there's no such thing.	0
Tell them about the free lunch.	0
I'd  love  to get people that are not linguists or engineers,	1
cuz these are both weird -	1
well, I know, I shouldn't  say  that.	1
The oth- the other h-	0
That's alright. No, the- they they're  very  weird.	0
We need a wider sampling.	0
The problem with engineers is "beep."	0
The o- the o- the other -	1
uh, that we we talked about is give to them uh, burn an extra C_D-ROM.	1
and give them So if they want a  basically and audio record of their -	0
Let them have their meeting.	0
Well,  I  thought that was -	0
I thought he meant, "Give them a music C_D," like they g-	0
Then he said a C_D of the of their speech and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you're talking to, but -	0
You know, I personally  would not want a  C_D  of my meeting, but	0
maybe yeah,  maybe you're right.	0
If you're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you'd like -	0
Oh, that's a good idea.	0
I think it would just be fun, you know, if nothing else, you know.	0
It it it also I think builds up towards the  goal.  We're saying, "Look, you know, you're gonna get this. Is- is- isn't that neat. Then you're gonna go home with it. It's actually p-	0
It's probably gonna be pretty useless to you,	0
but you'll ge- appreciate, you know, where it's useful and where it's useless,	0
and then, we're gonna move this technology, so it'll become  useful. "	0
No, I think that's a great idea, actually. But we might need a little more to incentivize them,  that's all.	0
What if you could tell them that you'll give them the the transcripts when they come back?	0
I mean,  anyone  can have the  transcripts.  So.	0
I hav- I have to uh raise a little eensy-weensy concern about doing th- giving them the C_D immediately,	0
I thought we could point that out.	0
because of these issues of, you know,  this  kind of stuff,	0
That's a very good point. So we can so we can -	0
We could burn it after it's been cleared with the transcript stage.	1
And then they they get a C_D, but just not the same day.	0
If It should be the same C_D-ROM that we distribute publically, right?	0
Right, it can't be the internal one.	0
Otherwise they're not  allowed  to	0
There  we go. Oh, I  like  that.	0
So, after the transcript screening phase.	1
Things have been weeded out.	0
Otherwise we'd need  two  lawyer stages.	0
"Yeah, well, I got this C_D, and, Your Honor, I -"	0
Yeah so that's so let's start with Haas, and	0
Sorry to have to -	0
Sorry I have to  leave.	0
I will be here full-time next week.	0
Let's see. So that was that topic,	0
then um, I guess another topic would be	1
where are we in the whole disk resources  question for -	1
We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp- room to record meetings.	0
So I uh did a bunch of archiving, and	0
still doing a bunch of archiving, I I'm in the midst of doing	0
and it took eleven hours	0
to do to uh copy it.	0
And it'll take  another  eleven to do the clone.	0
Where did you copy it to?	0
It's Abbott, so it just -	0
But it's it's a lot of data.	0
It's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott?	0
Oh, on the tape. Ah!	0
So I'm archiving it, and then I'm gonna delete the files.	0
So that will give us	0
ten gigabytes of free space.	0
Yeah, the archiving m-  program does take a long time.	0
That that will be done, like,	0
in about two hours. And so uh,	0
at that point we'll be able to record five more meetings. So.	0
One thing The  good  news about that that is that once once it's archived, it's pretty quick to get back. I mean, it it it The other direction is fast,	0
but this direction is really slow.	0
Well, especially because I'm generating a clone, also.	0
And that takes a while.	0
Yeah, that's a good point.	0
Now, what will uh Is the plan to g-  to -	0
stuff will be  saved,  it's just that you're relocating it?	0
I mean, so we're gonna get more disk space? Or did I ?	0
No, the the these are the P_files from Broadcast News, which are  regeneratable    regeneratable	0
um, if we really need to, but we had a  lot  of them.	0
And for the full, uh, hundred forty hour	0
And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had	0
six  of them or something.	0
W- w- we  are  getting more space. We  are  getting, uh, another disk rack and and four thirty-six gigabyte disks.	1
that's not gonna happen instantaneously.	1
The SUN, ha- uh, takes more disks than the Andatico one did.	0
The SUN  rack  takes -	0
One took four and one took six, or maybe it was eight and twelve. Whatever it was, it was,  you know, fifty percent more.	0
Is there a difference in price or something?	0
Well, what happened is that	0
we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years, according to Dave, and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices.	0
And so, uh, we're looking into other vendors.	0
By " we " of course I mean  Dave.  So.	0
Hmm. I've been looking at the, uh,	0
first first look at it,	0
directories on there that could be moved.	0
One was called Aurora, one was Spanish, which was Carmen's Spanish stuff, and the other one was, um,	0
I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that	0
the SPINE stuff was moving to a non-backed-up disk.	0
well, probably not all of that should be moved, just	0
C_D-ROM type data, the -	0
I asked him to check out and see if it was O_K.	0
before I actually deleted the old stuff,	0
um, but I haven't heard back  yet .	0
I told him he could delete it if he wanted to, I haven't checked	0
today to see if he's deleted it or not.	0
And then Carmen's stuff, I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to X_A,	0
I had copied stuff there that was	0
I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data.	0
And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk.	0
And then I lo- haven't done any of the Aurora stuff. I have to meet with, uh, Stephane	0
you're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you're clearing up from the Broadcast News,	0
other  disks, some of which you're using for Aurora, but	0
are we g- do we have some other -	0
uh, we have space on the current disk right now, where Meeting Recorder is,	0
and that's probably enough for about four meetings.	0
Is that the one that has is that D_C?	0
No, no,  well, it's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is. I think it's D_I.	0
O_K, I but the stuff I'm moving from Aurora is on the D_C disk that we -	0
Th- I think it's D_C- It's whatever that one is.	0
I just don't remember, it might be D_C.	0
that has enough for about four  more   meetings right now.	0
Yeah, I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty-six for reasons I don't understand.	0
Um, someone deleted something somewhere.	0
And so we have some room again.	0
with Broadcast News, that's five or six more meetings, so, you know, we have a couple weeks.	0
Uh, so, yeah, I think I think we're O_K, until we get the new disk.	0
One question I had for you was,	0
we sh- probably should move the Aurora an-	0
and all that other stuff off of	0
Is there another backed-up  disk that you know of that would ?	0
We should put it onto the Broadcast News one.	0
That's probably the best thing to do. And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk  rather than spreading them out.	0
Right. Do you know what happen to know what disk that is off ? O_K.	0
I mean, I can tell you, I just don't know off the top of my head.	0
Alright, I'll find out from you.	0
But, so we could jus- just do that at the end of today, once the archive is complete, and I've verified it.	0
Cuz that'll give us plenty of disk.	0
then I guess th- the last thing I'd had on my -	1
my  agenda was just to hear hear an update on	1
what what Jose has been doing, so  that's  -	1
The result of my work during the last days.	1
Thank you for your information because I -	0
Eh, and the the last, eh, days, eh, I work, eh, in my house,	0
eh, in a lot of ways and	0
thinking, reading eh, different things about the the Meeting Recording project.	0
And I have, eh, some ideas.	0
Eh, this information is very very useful.	1
I'm glad to hear it. Glad to hear it.	0
Because  you have the the the distribution, now. But	1
for me, eh is interesting because, eh, eh,	1
here's i- is the demonstration of the overlap, eh,  problem. It's a real problem,	1
uh, because you have overlapping zones eh, eh, eh, all the time.	1
Eh, by a moment I have, eh, nnn, the, eh,  n- I I  did a mark of  all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording,	1
with eh, a  exact   mark.	0
Oh, you did that by hand?	0
b- b- Yeah, by b- b- by hand by hand because,	1
Can I get a copy?	0
My my idea is to work -	0
I I I do- I don- I don't  @@  -	0
I don't know, eh, if, eh, it will be possible because I I I haven't a lot eh, enough time to to to work.	0
uh, only just eh, six months, as you know,	0
but, eh, my idea is, eh,	1
is very interesting to to work  in in the line of, eh, automatic segmenter.	1
in my opinion,  we need eh, eh, a reference  eh session	0
to t- to to evaluate	0
And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already?	1
No, no, with i- Sorry? With ?	0
Have you done that or are you planning to do that?	0
No, I I plan to do that.	1
I plan I plan, but eh,	0
eh, the idea  is the is the following.	0
to detect eh all the overlapping zones exactly.	1
I I will I will eh, talk about eh,  in the in the  blackboard	0
eh, with eh, exactly time marks	1
eh, for the overlapping zones	1
overlapping zone, and eh, a speaker -	1
a a pure speech eh, eh, speaker zone.	1
I mean, eh zones eh of eh speech of eh, one speaker	1
without any any eh, noise eh, any any acoustic event eh that eh, eh, w- eh, is not eh, speech,  real  speech.	1
And, I need t-  true  eh, silence	0
for that, because my my idea is to to study the nnn the -	1
eh, what, eh, are more m- more discriminant	1
the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech  eh zones.	1
to eh to use -	1
eh, I'm not sure to eh yet,	1
but eh my idea is	1
to use a a cluster   eh algorithm or, nnn,	1
a  person strong  in neural net algorithm	1
what is the, eh, the  property  of the different feat- eh feature, eh, to classify	1
eh speech and overlapping eh speech.	1
And my idea is eh,	0
it would be interesting to to have	0
And my control set eh, will be the eh, silence,	1
silence without eh, any any noise.	1
Which means that we'd still You'd hear the Yeah.  That's interesting. This is like a ground level, with It's not- it's not total silence.	0
With with, yeah, the background. Eh,	0
I I mean eh, noise eh,	0
eh claps eh,  tape  clips, eh, the difference eh,	0

So so you intend to hand-mark those and exclude them?	0
in in in in that Not in all in all the the file,	0
only eh, eh, nnn,  mmm,	0
I don't remind  what is the the the the quantity, but eh,	0
I I have  marked   enough speech on over- and all the overlapping zones.	0
I have, eh,  two hundred and thirty,	1
more or less, overlapping zones, and	1
is similar to to this information,   because with the program, I cross	1
the information of uh, of Jane	0
with eh, my- my segmentation by hand.	0
And  is eh, mor- more similar.	0
Excellent. Glad to hear it. Good.	0
And the the idea is, eh,	0
I I will use, eh, -	0
I should've  got the digital camera. Oh well.	0
I I need eh, the exact eh, mark	0
eh, zones because I I want to put, eh, for eh, each frame a label  indicating.	1
It's a  sup- supervised  and, eh, hierarchical clustering process.	1
I I I put, eh, eh,	1
indicating what is th- the type,	1
what is the class, eh, which it belong.	1
Eh, I mean, the class you will	0
These will be assigned by hand?	0
I I I ha- I h- I I put the mark by hand,	1
in in the first session,	1
I need, eh,  I I need, eh, to be  sure	1
eh, that, eh, I I will cluster,	1
is is right. Because, eh,	1
eh, if  not,  eh, I will I will, eh, return to the speech file to analyze eh, what is the problems, eh.	1
And  I I'd prefer I would prefer, the- to to have, eh, this labeled automatically, but, eh,	0
Yeah,  but this  is what you're  starting  with.	0
I've gotta ask you. So,	0
uh, the difference between the  top  two,	0
i- So so I start at the bottom, so "silence" is clear.	0
By "speech" do you mean speech by one sp- by one person only?	0
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is -	0
O_K , and then and then the top includes	0
people speaking at the same time, or or a speaker and a breath overlapping, someone else's breath, or or clicking, overlapping with speech So,	0
One or- two or more.	0
No, by th- by the moment n-	0
that that's all those possibilities in the top one.  O_K.	0
Eh, in the first moment, because, eh, eh, I I have information, eh, of the overlapping zones,	0
eh, information about if the, eh, overlapping zone is, eh, from a speech,  clear  speech, from a one to a two eh speaker,	0
or three speaker, or is is the zone where the breath of a speaker eh, overlaps eh, onto eh, a speech, another,	0
So it's basi- it's basically speech wi- som- with with something overlapping, which could be speech but doesn't need to be.	0
No, no, es- especially  eh, overlapping speech	0
from, eh, different eh, eh, speaker.	0
No, but there's but, I think she's saying "Where do you In these three categories, where do you put the instances	0
in which there is one person speaking	0
and other sounds which are not speech?"	0
Which category do you put  that  in?	0
Yeah, that's right. That's my question.	0
Yeah, he- here I I put eh speech from eh,	0
eh, any any any events more.	0
so where do you put speech from one speaker	0
that  does  have a nonspeech event at the same time?	0
Where? Where What is the class?	0
No. By the moment, no.	0
Yeah, yeah, that's what he was saying before.	0
So you don't i- i- it's not in that -	0
For for the by the  @@	0
no,  @@  because I I I I want to  limit	0
the the nnn,  the the study.	0
Yeah, so that's what he was saying before, is that he  excluded  those.	0
So you're not using  all  of the data.	0
So you're ignoring overlapping events unless they're speech with speech.	1
"Why? Why? What's the reason?"  because	0
i- it's the first study.	0
Oh, no no, it's a perfectly sensible way to go. We just wondered -	0
trying to understand what what you were doing. O_K.	0
Yeah cuz you've talked about other overlapping events in the  past.  So,	0
this is this is a  subset.	0
In the in the future, the the idea is to to extend  the class,	1
to consider all the all the information, you you mentioned before	0
Yeah, I I don't think we were asking for that. We were jus- just trying to understand -	0
but eh, the the first idea Because eh, I don't know	0
Yeah, we just wanted to know what the category was here.	0
what hap- what will happen  with the study. Yeah.	0
Is your silence category pure silence, or ? What if there was a door-slam or something?	0
No, no, it's pure silence.	0
It's pure si- pure silence  with the with the machine on the on the roof.	0
I I think what you m-	0
I think what you mean  is that it's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises.	0
Right? Cuz you're calling what you're calling "event" is somebody coughing	1
or clicking, or rustling paper, or hitting something, which are impulsive noises.	1
But steady-state noises are part of the background.	1
Which,  are being , included in that. Right?	0
So it's like a signal-noise situation.	0
I I I I I think I I think, eh,	0
there are that some kind of noises that, eh,	0
don't don't  wanted  to to be in that, eh,	0
But I prefer, I prefer at at the first, eh,	0
the the silence with eh, this eh this kind	0
of the of eh of noise.	0
Right, it's I mean, it's "Background" might be might be a better word than "silence". It's just sort of that the the background acoustic -	1
Is is is only -	0
Well, we needed to get the categories, yeah.	0
And, um,  with  this information	0
The idea is eh, eh, nnn,	0
a label for for each, eh,  frame  and, eh with a cluster	0
I am going  to prepare	1
a test bed, eh, well, eh,	1

if you you use the the neural network?  If -	0
w- when  this kind of eh, mmm, cluster, clustering algorithm	0
to can test, to can eh observe what happened	0
Right, you can't analyze it.	0
eh put up  with your hand	0
in the different parameter, but eh -	0
If you use a neural net is is a good idea, but eh	0
you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net.	0
Well, actually, you  can  do sensitivity analyses	0
which show you what the importance of the different  parce-   pieces of the input are.	0
It's hard to w- w- what you It's hard to tell on a neural net is what's going on  internally.	0
But it's actually not that hard to analyze it and figure out the effects of different inputs, especially if they're all normalized.	0
Well, using something simpler first I think is probably fine.	0
Well, this isn't tru- if if if you  really  wonder what different if if -	0
Yeah, then a decision tree is really good, but the thing is here he's he's not he's not like he has  one	1
you know, a bunch of very distinct variables, like pitch and this he's talking about, like, a- all these cepstral coefficients, and so forth, in which case	1
a- a- any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess, and it's gonna be hard to figure out what what uh -	1
I I I will  include  too the the the differential  de-  derivates	0
I I mean, I think the other thing that one I mean, this is, I think a good thing to do, to sort of look at these things at least -	0
See what I'd I'd Let me tell you what  I  would do.	0
just a  few  features. Instead of taking all the M_F_C_C's, or all the P_L_P's or whatever,	1
I would just take a  couple.	1
O_K? Like like C_one, C_two, something like that, so that you can  visualize  it.	1
and look at these different examples and look at  scatter  plots.	1
O_K, so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers,	1
just take a look in two dimensions, at how these things are split apart.	1
That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is  likely  to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier.	0
And the second thing is, once you actually  get  to the point of building these classifiers,	0
what  this  lacks so far is the  temporal  properties.	0
So if you're just looking at a frame and a time, you don't know anything about, you know, the structure of it over  time,  and so	1
you may wanna build  @@  build a Markov model of some sort	1
or else have features that really are based on	1
on on some bigger chunk of time.	1
But I think this is a good place to start.	0
But don't uh- anyway, this is my suggestion, is don't just, you know,	1
throw in twenty features at it, the deltas, and the delta del- and all that	1
into some classifier, even -	1
even  if it's K_nearest-neighbors, you  still  won't know what it's doing, even You know it's not a neural net.	1
Uh, I think to know what it's to have a better feeling for what it's doing, you wanna  look  at it.	0
So you wanna look at at som- some picture that shows you, "Here's These things uh, uh are offer some separation."	0
And, uh, in L_P_C, uh, the thing to particularly look at is, I think is something	1
like, uh, the residual the energy in the residual.	1
Can I ask? It  strikes  me that there's  another  piece of information	0
might be useful and that's simply the  transition.	0
So, w- if you go from a transition of  silence  to  overlap  versus a transition from  silence  to  speech,	0
there's gonna be a b- a  big  informative area there, it seems to me.	0
I Yeah. But eh I I Is my- my my own vision,  of the of the project.	0
So, some sort of -	0
eh the the Meeting Recorder project, for me,	0
eh, w- has eh several parts, several p-  objective eh, because it's a -	0
a  great  project. But eh, at the first, in the acoustic, eh, eh, parts of the project,	0
you eh we have eh	0
One one of these is to eh to detect the change, the acoustic change.	0
And  for that, if you don't use, eh,	0
eh broad class, or not broad class	0
to to try to to	0
to label the different frames,	0
I think  the Ike criterion	0
I I I I would like to to t- prove.	0
you have, eh, eh s- eh the transition of speech or or silence	0
probably with, eh, this kind of, eh,	0
eh the the the more eh use eh use eh  used   eh	0
em  normal,  regular  eh parameter M_F-  M_F_C_C.	0
you you have to to to find you can find	0
You can find the nnn, the the acoustic change.	0
I I understand that you your objective is  to eh  classify,	1
to know that eh that zone	1
not is  only   a new zone in the in the file,	1
that eh you have eh, but you have to to to know that this is  overlap  zone.	1
because in the future you will eh	1
try to to process that zone	1
with a non- regular  eh eh speech recognizer model, I suppose.	1
to to to  process  the overlapping z- eh zone	1
with another kind of algorithm because it's very difficult to -	1
to to obtain the  transcription	1
from eh using eh eh a regular, normal speech recognizer.	1
That , you know,  I I I think is the idea.	0
more acc- the mor- most accurately possible	1
that is p- uh, will  be  possible	1
or several models, to try s- but -	1
eh several model- eh robust models, sample models	1
I'm I'm I'm sorry, I didn't  understand   you what you said. What what model?	0
of the- of the n-	0
to detect the different class	0
before try to to recognize, eh	0
with eh to transcribe, with eh	0
And my idea is to use eh, for example, a neural net	0
with  the  information we obtain from this eh this eh study	0
of the parameter with the  selected  parameter to try to eh to put	0
the class of each frame.	0
Eh  for  the difference  zone	0
with the  for example, BIC eh, eh  criterion	0
O_K, but, I I think in  any  event we're agreed that the first step is -	0
Because what we had before for for uh, speaker change detection did not include these overlaps.	1
So the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps.	1
Right? So again, I think	0
the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh, in in in -	0
again, the things you've written up there I think are way too way too big.	0
O_K? If you're talking about, say, twelfth twelfth-order uh M_F_C_C's or something like that it's just way too much. You won't be able to  look  at it.	0
All you'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does.	0
Whereas I think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional	0
things, or three of you have some very fancy display,	0
uh, and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out, you'll have much more insight about what's going on.	0
Well, you'll you'll get a  feeling  for what's happening, you know, so if you look at -	1
Suppose you look at first- and second-order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things	1
and you find that the first-order is much more effective than the second,	1
and then you look at the third and there's not and not too much there,	1
first- and second-order cepstral coefficients, right? And with L_P_C, I think L_P_C per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than than the other, maybe.	1
Uh, and uh on the other hand, the L_P_C residual, the energy in the L_P_C residual,	1
will say how well, uh	1
model's fitting it, which should be	1
pretty poorly for two- two or more	1
people speaking at the same time, and it should be pretty well, for w- for for one.	1
And so  I i- again, if you take a few of these things that are are	0
prob- um    promising  features and look at them in pairs,	0
uh, I think you'll have much more of a sense of "O_K, I now have -	0
uh, doing a bunch of these analyses, I now have ten likely candidates."	1
And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine.	1
eh eh eh I don't  know it  is the first eh way to to do that	0
and I would eh like to to know what eh, your opinion.	0
all this study in the f- in the first moment,	0
I I w- I I will pretend to do  with eh eh	0
The the equalizes speech, the speech eh, the  mixes  of speech.	0
the the mix,  mixed  speech.	0
Eh, why? Because eh the spectral distortion is -	0
more eh a lot eh clearer,	0
very much clearer if we compare with the P_D_A.	0
P_D_A speech file is eh it will be eh difficult. I -	0
The the P_D_A is messier.	0
Because the n- the noise eh to sp- the signal-to-noise relation is eh is is low.	0
And ,  I don't know -	0
Yeah, I think that that's a good way to start. But.	0
I don't know eh uh i- i- that eh the -	0
the result of the of the study eh with eh with eh this eh this speech, the mix speech	0
eh  will work   exactly   with the  eh P_D_A files.	0
It would be interesting in  itself  to see.	0
Well, I think that would be an interesting  result.	0
eh What, I I mean, what- what is the effect	0
signal to to to noise relation, you know, eh with -	0
Well, I think I think I think it's not a it's not at all unreasonable. It makes sense to start with the simpler signal	0
because if you have features which don't aren't even	0
in the  high  signal-to-noise ratio, then there's no point in putting them into the  low  signal ratio, one would  think,  anyway.	1
And so, if you can get -	1
Uh again, my prescription would be	1
that you would, with a mixed	1
signal, you would take a collection of possible uh, features	1
look at how these different classes that you've marked, separate themselves,	1
and then collect, uh in pairs,	1
and then collect ten of them or something, and then proceed	1
And then if you can get that to work well,	1
then you go to the other signal.	1
And then, and you and you know, they won't work as well, but	0
how m- you know, how much -	0
And then you can re-optimize, and so on.	0
Yeah. But it- I think it would be interesting to try a  couple  with  both.	0
Because it I think it would be  interesting  to see if some features work well with close  mixed,  and -	0
Ah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah.  @@	0
It it's it's true that it also, it could be  useful to do this exploratory analysis where you're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases. Sure.	0
I I I I think that the the eh parameter we found, eh,	0
eh, speech file, but eh what is the the -	1
the relation of eh of the	1
performance when eh you use eh the, eh	1
eh speech file- the P_D_A speech files. Yeah, I don't know. But it -	1
I I I I think it will be important.	0
Because eh people eh eh, different groups eh has eh experience with this eh kind of problem. Is eh is not easy	0
eh to to solve, because if you  I I -	0
I have seen the the the speech file from eh P_D_A, and s-	0
some parts is  very difficult because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram.    Is  very difficult to apply	0
a parameter to detect change when you don't see. But I suppose -	0
that that's another reason why very simple features, things like energy, and things -	1
Yeah, yeah yeah, I I I will put eh the energy here.	0
things like harmonicity, and  residual energy are	1
uh, yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they'll be more reliable.	1
Ch- Chuck was gonna ask something  I guess .	0
Yeah. You have a  question .  Yeah.	0
Yeah, I  maybe this is a dumb question, but	0
w- I thought it would be  I thought it would be easier if you used a P_D_A because can't you, couldn't you like use	1
beam-forming or something to- detect speaker overlaps?	1
Well, if you used the  array,  rather than the signal from just  one.	1
Yeah, no, you- you're you're right that -	0
In fact, if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones, you  do  have some location information.	0
which we don't have with the one	0
and and so that's -	0
Is that not allowed with this project?	0
Uh, well, no, I mean, we- we don't have any  rules,  r- really. I think -	1
But I didn't mean I w-  Given given the goal.	0
I mean, is is that violation of the -	0
I I think I think it's it's it's a it's an  additional  interesting question.	1
I mean, I think you wanna  know  whether you can do it with one, because	0
you know  it's not necessarily true that every device that you're trying to do this with will have  two.	0
Uh, if, on the other hand, we show that there's a  huge  advantage with two, well then that could be a real  point.	0
But, we don't n- even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect  overlaps  is. You know, maybe it doesn't  matter  too much.	0
So, this is all pretty early stages. But no, you're absolutely right. That's  a good thing to consider.	1
There there  is  a complication though, and that is if a person turns their back to the to the P_D_A, then some of the positional information goes away?	0
Well, it it it  does,  i- it d- it  does,  but the -	0
No, it's not it's not  that  so much as -	0
the the issue is that that -	0
And if they're on the access  on the  axis  of it, that was the other thing I was thinking.	0
He  You  mentioned this last time, that that if if you're straight down the midline,	0
Yeah, we hav- need to put it on a little turntable, and -	0
then then the r- the left-right's gonna be different, and and and in  his  case,	0
I mean, he's closer to it anyway. It seems to me that that it's not a p- uh, you know, it's this the topograph- the topology of it is is a little bit complicated.	0
But it's another source of information.	0
I don't I don't know ho-	0
I I I think Sorry.	0
I I I think because the- the- the distance between the two microph-	0
eh, microphone, eh, in the P_D_A is	0
very near. But it's uh -	0
from my opinion, it's an interesting idea	0
to to try to study the  binaural	0
eh problem eh, with information, because I I found	0
difference between the the speech from from each micro-	0
Yeah, it's  timing  difference. It- it's not amplitude, right?	0
Oh yeah! Oh I agree! And we use it  ourselves.	0
I mean, I know I n- I know that's a very important cue.	0
But I'm just I'm just saying that	0
the way we're seated around a table,	0
with respect to each to each person with respect to the P_D_A, so we're gonna have	0
a lot of differences with ref- respect to the speaker.	0
But th- I don't think that  matters,  though.	0
That's So so i-  @@	0
I think the issue is,	0
"Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction?"	0
If it's not coming from just one direction, if it if th- if there's a broader pattern, it means that it's more likely there's  multiple   people speaking,	0
So it's sort of like how how  confused  is it	0
Is it a is it -	0
Yeah, is there a narrow -	0
about where the beam is.	0
Is there a  narrow  beam pattern or is it a a  distributed  beam pattern?	1
So if there's a  distributed  beam pattern, then it looks more like it's it's uh, multiple people.	1
Wherever you are, even if he moves around.	0
O_K, it just it just seemed to me that -	0
that this isn't the ideal type of separation. I mean, I I think it's -	0
I can see the value o-	0
Oh, ideal would be to have the wall  filled  with them, but I mean -	0
But the thing is just having two mikes If you looked at that thing on on Dan's page,	0
it was When when there were two people speaking, and it looked  really  really different.	0
Oh yeah yeah. O_K. Yeah.	0
Uh, well, basic- he was looking at correlation.	0
Just cross-correlation between two sides.	0
So cross-correlation is pretty sensitive.	0
I'm not sure what Dan's page is that you mean. He was looking at the two -	0
Uh, his a web page.	0
You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros- and you cross-correlate them with different lags.	0
So when one person is speaking, then wherever they happen to be at the point when they're speaking,	0
then there's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l- in in the lag.	0
So if at whatever angle you  are,	0
So so if there's  two  -	0
at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two  there,	0
you get this boost in the in in the cross-correlation value function.	0
And if there are multiple people  talking,  you'll see two peaks.	1
Well, let me ask you, if if both people were over there,	0
it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across, catty-corner? No?	0
The- the Oh, I'm sorry, if they're right next to one another? i- i-	0
If I was if I was  here  and Morgan was  there  and we were both talking,	0
Next next one over n- over  on this side of the P_ P_D_A.	0
Good example, the same one I'm asking.	0
Versus you versus you know, and we're catty-corner across the table, and I'm farther away from this one and you're farther away from  that  one.	0
Or or even if, like,	0
It seems like that would be pretty strong.	0
if people were sitting right  across  from each other, you couldn't tell the difference  either.	0
Across the same axis, you don't have as much to differentiate.	0
And so my point was just that it's it's gonna be differentially -	0
we d- yeah, we don't have a third dimension there. Yeah, so it's -	0
I mean, it's not to say I mean, I  certainly  think it's  extremely  val-  And we we humans  n- n-  depend  on  you know, these these binaural cues. But.	0
But it's almost but it's almost a -	0
I think what you're talking about i- there's  two  things. There's a sensitivity issue, and then there's a pathological error uh issue.	0
So th- the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a  pathological  error. If someone just  happens  to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it.	0
O_K. and i- and if there So it And if it's the two of you guys on the same side -	0
Uh, if they're if they're  close,  it's just a question of the sensitivity.	0
So if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough, uh, experience with it to know how -	0
Yeah. Oh I'm not I'm not trying to argue against using it, by any means. I just wanted to point out that -	0
that weakness, that it's topo- topologically impossible	0
And I think Dan is still working on it. So. He actually -	0
to get it perfect for everybody.	0
he wrote me about it a little bit, so.	0
Great. No, I don't mean to discourage that at all.	0
I mean, the other thing you can do uh, if I mean, i- We're  assuming  that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the P_D_A.	0
But if you h- put a  third  in,	0
you could put in the other axis. And then you know then you're sort of -	0
Once you got  two  -	0
Yeah, then then you pretty much could cover -	0
Well what about just doing it from  these  mikes?	0
It will be more interesting to study the P_Z_M because the the the separation I I think -	0
I mean, we can- we'll be all of this is there for us to study.	0
Yeah, we can do whatever we want.	0
but but the thing is, uh, one of the at least  one  of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what	1
can we do with what we  think  would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a P_D_A.	1
That's what I was asking about, what are the constraints?	0
Yeah. Well, that's that's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were were were interested in.	0
Uh, but you know if you can  instrument  a room,	1
this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing, right? Some people at at uh, yeah, at Brown and and and and at uh	1
Didn't they have something at Cape?  Uh.	0
they both have these, you know, big arrays on the wall. And you know, if you could do that, you've got microphones all over the place	0
uh, you know p-  tens  of microphones, and and uh -	0
Oh! I saw a  demo.	0
And if you do that then you can really get very nice uh kind of selectivity -	0
Oh, I saw one that was like	0
a  hundred  microphones, a ten by ten array. And they had  very  precision.  -	0
And you could In a noisy room, they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody.	0
It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it.	0
It was yeah, it was interesting.	0
the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir- my first concern is because	1
um, I'm interested in what happens for people,  random  people out in some random place where they're p- having an impromptu discussion.	1
And you can't just always go, "well, let's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se- to set up".	0
No, what you need to do is you'd have	0
a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall. It has all these mikes and it has a plug-in jack to the P_D_A.	0
The  other  thing actually, that gets at this a little bit of something  else  I'd like to do, is what happens if you have two  P_D_As   and they  communicate  with each other?	1
And then You know, they're in random positions, the likelihood that I mean, basically there wouldn't be any l- likely to be  any  kind of nulls, if you even had  two.	1
That's on my web pages.  Yeah.	0
If you had three or four it's -	1
All sorts of interesting things you can  do  with that, I mean, not only can you do  microphone  arrays, but you can do all sorts of um	1
So it's it  would  be neat.	0
I still like my rug on the wall idea, so if anybody patents that, then -	0
But I think in terms of -	0
Well, you could have  strips  that you  stick  to your  clothing.	0
In terms of the  research   th-  research,  it's really -	0
it's  whatever  the person who is doing the  research   wants  to  do.	0
So if if Jose is  interested  in that, that's  great.  But if if	0
he's not, that's great  too.	0
Um, I i- I i-	0
I would actually kind of like us to wind it down, see if we can still	0
get to the end of the, uh,  birthdays  thing there.	0
Well, I had a couple things that I  did  wanna bring out. One is, do we need to sign new these again?	0
Well, it's slightly different. So I I would say it would be a good idea.	0
Cuz  it it's slightly different.	0
Oh, this  morning  we didn't  sign  anything cuz we said that if anybody had  signed  it already, we didn't  have  to.	0
Yeah, I I should've checked with Jane first, but the ch- the  form  has changed.	0
So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form.	0
I had to make one -	0
Um, I had some things I wanted to talk about with the  thresholding  stuff I'm doing.	0
But, if we're in a  hurry,  we can put that off.	0
and then also  anonymity,  how we want to  anonymize  the data.	1
I mean I have some results to present, but I mean I guess we won't have time to do that this time.	0
But it seems like um the anonymization is uh,	0
is  also  something that we might wanna discuss in greater length.	0
Um. I mean, wha- what -	0
If if we're about to wind down, I think what  I  would prefer is that we uh, delay the anonymization thing till next week, and I would like to present	0
the results that I have on the overlaps.	0
We still have to do this, too, right?	0
No- well, we don't  have  to do digits.	0
Well,  why don't we  -	0
uh, there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about. Why don't we just take a couple minutes to to  briefly	0
do them, and then and then and then and then and then we -	0
I'd Oh, I'd prefer to have more  time  for my results. e-	0
Could I do that next week maybe?	0
O_K, that's what I'm asking.	0
And I think the anonymization, if y- if you want to proceed with that now, I just think that that's that's a discussion which  also	0
really deserves a lo- a you know, more that just a minute. I really do think that, because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself, you and I have discussed it previously, and there are different ways that people approach it, e- and I think we should -	0
Alright. We're we're just -	0
We're getting enough data now that I'd sort of like to do it now, before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it	0
going and dealing with it.	0
I I'll give you the short version, but I do think it's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes.	0
the the short thing is	0
uh, tape recording- uh, uh, sorry, digitized recor- recordings.	0
Those we won't be able to change. If someone says "Hey, Roger so-and-so".	0
So that's gonna stay that person's name.	0
Now, in terms of like the  transcript,	0
the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody's name,	1
and whether you're gonna put it  in  the text where he says "Hey Roger" or are we gonna put that person's anonymized name in instead?	1
No, because  then    that  would give you a  mapping,	0
and you don't  wanna  have a mapping.	0
O_K, so first decision is, we're gonna anonymize the same name	0
for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker's name is mentioned.	0
Because that would give you a  mapping  between the speaker's  real  name and the  tag  we're using,	1
I I don't think you understood what I what I said. So -	0
and we don't want -	1
uh, so in within the context of an utterance, someone says "So, Roger, what do  you  think?"	0
Then, uh, it seems to me that -	1
Well, maybe I uh it seems to me that if you change the name,	1
the transcript's gonna disagree with the audio, and you won't be able to use that.	1
We don't we wanna we ha- we want the transcript to be " Roger ".	0
Right, you don't wanna do that.	0
Because if we made the the  transcript  be the  tag  that we're using for Roger,	1
someone who had the  transcript  and the  audio  would then have a  mapping	1
between the  anonymized  name and the  real  name, and we wanna  avoid  that.	1
there's this issue of if we're gonna use this for a  discourse  type of thing,	1
and, you know, Liz was mentioning stuff in  a  previous meeting about gaze direction and who's who's the  addressee  and all,	1
then to have "Roger" be the thing in the  utterance  and then actually have the  speaker  identifier who  was  "Roger" be " Frank ",	1
that's going to be  really   confusing  and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis.	1
Ugh!    That's a good point.	0
Now, if you want to, you know, I mean, in some cases, I I I know that Susan Ervin-Tripp in some of hers, uh, actually did do uh, um, a filter of the s- signal where the person's name was mentioned, except	0
And and I cer- and I So, I mean, the question then becomes one level  back.	1
Um, how important  is  it for a person to be identified by first name versus  full  name?	1
uh, it's not a full identity, we're taking all these precautions,	0
and  they'll  be taking precautions, which are probably even the more  important  ones, to they'll be reviewing the transcripts, to see if there's something they don't like  O_K.	0
So, maybe, uh, maybe that's enough protection. On the other hand,	1
this is a small this is a small pool, and people who say things about topic X_	1
e- who are researchers and well-known in the field, they'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name.	1
However, taking one step  further  back, they'd be identifiable  anyway,  even if we  changed  all the names.	1
So, is it really, um -	0
Now, in terms of like so I I did some results, which I'll report on n- next time,	0
which  do  mention individual speakers by  name.	0
Now,  there,  the Human Subjects Committee is very precise.	0
You don't wanna mention subjects by name	0
Now, it would be very  possible  for me to take those data	1
put them in a in a study, and just change everybody's name for the purpose of the publication.	1
Yeah, once you get to the publication you can certainly do that. You can go, you know, uh, "Z_"  uh, for instance. Uh.	0
And someone who looked -	1
Yeah, exactly. Doesn't matter if -	0
Um, yeah, I mean, t- it doesn't -	0
I mean, I'm not knowledgeable about this, but it certainly doesn't bother  me  to have someone's first name in in the in the transcript.	0
That's the same thing you saw.	0
Uh, I think you don't wanna have their  full  name to be uh,	0
Yeah, and and in the form that they sign,	0
it does say "your first name may arise in the course of the meetings".	0
So again, th- the issue is if you're tracking discourse things, you know, if someone says, uh, uh, "Frank said this" and then you wanna connect it to something later, you've gotta have this part where that's "Frank colon". Right?	1
Yeah, and and you know, even more i- i- uh, immediate than that just	1
Well, it just seems like to  track   track from one utterance to the next utterance who's speaking and who's speaking	1
to whom, cuz that can be important. S-	1
i- You know, "You raised the point, So-and-so", it's be kind of nice to	0
be able to know who " you " was. And ac-	0
I I'm thinking too much.	0
and actually you remember  furthermore,  you remember last time we had this discussion of how	0
you know, I was sort of avoiding mentioning people's names,	0
and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial. Well, I mean, if we're going to step in after the fact and change people's names in the  transcript,  we've basically done something one step  worse.	0
Yeah, I was  too.  Yeah.	0
Well, I would sug- I I  don't  wanna change the names in the transcript, but that's because I'm focused so much on the  acoustics  instead of on the  discourse,  and so I think that's a  really  good  point.	1
You're  right,  this is going to require more  thought.	1
L- let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the, uh, what we're covering in the meeting.	0
Uh I realize when you're doing this that uh -	0
I mean, I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about.	0
Uh, and so, uh -	0
and so I was proceeding some- somewhat at random,	0
frankly. So I think what would be helpful would be	0
and I'll I'll mention this to to Liz and Andreas too,	0
before the meeting if anybody could send me, any any, uh, uh,	0
agenda items that they were interested in	0
and I'll I'll take the role of organizing them	0
uh, into into the agenda,	0
but I'd be  very  pleased to have everyone else	0
completely make up the agenda. I've no desire to  to make it up, but	0
if if no one's told me things, then I'm just proceeding from my my guesses, and -	0
and i- ye- yeah, I I'm sorry it ended up with your- out your time to -	0
Oh, it's not a problem. Not a problem. Yeah.	0
I mean, I'm just always asking Jose what he's doing, you know, and  and so it's  There's uh, there's obviously other things going on.	0
I just I just couldn't do it in two minutes.	0
How will we how would the person who's doing the  transcript	1
even  know  who they're  talking  about?	1
Do you know what I'm saying?	0
"The person who's doing the transcript -"  The  I_B_M  people?	0
I mean, so- so how is that information gonna get labeled  anyway?	1
How do you mean, who what they're who they're talking about?	0
I mean, so if I'm saying in a meeting, "oh and  Bob,  by the way, wanted wanted to do  so-and-so ",	0
They're just gonna write " Bob " on it or do  @@  -	0
Yeah,  @@  they're just gonna write "Bob".	0
They won't be able to change it  themselves.	0
If you're if you're doing  discourse  analysis,  a-	0
What ar- how are they gonna do  any  of this?	0
Well, I I'm betting we're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un-	0
I mean, they're gonna say speaker-one, or speaker-two or speaker- I mean I I -	0
Well, the  current  one they don't do  speaker  identity.	1
because in NaturallySpeaking, or,  excuse  me, in  ViaVoice,  it's only one  person.	1
and so in their  current  conventions there  are  no multiple speaker  conventions.	1
So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words.	0
Oh.  I think that My understanding from Yen-	0
Is it Yen-Ching? Is that how you pronounce her name? Oh, uh  Yu-Ching?  Yu-Ching?	0
was that um, they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed,	0
where they put speaker identifier down.	0
But, you know, h- they won't know these people, so I think	0
it's Well, they'll they'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified	0
to them So they'll do something	0
like speaker-one, speaker-two, is what  I  bet, but I'm betting there'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers. We'll have to review the transcripts in any case.	0
And it and it may very  well  be I mean, since	0
they're not going to sit there and and and worry ab- about, uh, it being the same speaker,	0
they may very  well  go the eh the the first se- the first time it changes to another speaker, that'll be speaker- two.  And the next time it'll be speaker- three  even if it's actually speaker- one.	0
You know, that would be a very practical solution on their part.	0
Yeah. It's a good idea.	0
And and but then we would need to label it. And that's O_K.	0
Yeah.  Yeah, I think -	0
Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close-talking mikes.	0
Yes, I was thinking, the temp- the time values of when it changes.	0
So. But I mean that doesn't -	0
This doesn't answer the the  question.	0
It's a good point, "which what do you do for discourse tracking?"	0
Because y- y- you don't know to know, eh -	0
you don't need to know what i- what is the iden- identification of the of the speakers. You only	0
eh want to know -	0
For for  acoustics  you don't but for  discourse  you do.	0
Yeah. If if if if someone says, uh, "what what is Jose  doing? " and then Jose  says  something, you need to know that that was Jose  responding.	0
Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id- to make a point of  not  identifying people by name, which then leads you to be more contextually ex- explicit.	0
Well, people are very flexible. You know? I mean, so when we did this las- last week, I felt that you know, now, Andreas may, uh,	0
i- sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they  miss  a sentence or something, and -	0
and because he  missed  something, then he missed the r- the initial introduction of who we were  talking  about, and was was unable to do the  tracking.  But I felt like  most  of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the  name.  So, people are really flexible.	0
But, you know, like, at the beginning of  this  meeting -	0
Or,  you  I think said,  you know, or s-  Liz,  said something about um, uh, "is  Mari  gonna use the  equipment? "	0
I mean,  how  would you  say  that?	0
I mean, you  have  to really  think,	0
if you wanted to  anonymize.	0
you know, about what you're  saying  bef-	0
"Is you know who up in you know where?" Right? Use the -	0
I think it would be really  hard  if we made a policy where we didn't say  names,	0
Yeah,  darn!  I mean, what I was gonna  say  is that the other  option  is that we could bleep  out  the  names.	0
plus we'd have to  tell  everybody  else.	0
but then, again that kills your  discourse  analysis.  Ugh!	0
I I think the I think -	0
I don't know, my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what's in	0
to the extent you  can,	0
Well, but that- but that as I said, that that that works great for the  acoustics,  but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do  discourse.	0
the speakers have signed the forms and all.	0
Because you don't have a map of who's  talking  versus  their  name that they're being  referred  to.	0
I thought we were gonna get it labeled speaker-one, speaker-two -	0
Sure but, h- then you have to  know  that Jose is speaker-one and -	0
Why do you have to know his name?	0
O_K, so suppose someone says, "well I don't know if I really heard what -	0
And part of your learning about the  dialogue  is Jose  responding  to it.	0
But it doesn't  say  "Jose", it says "speaker- five ".	0
Oh, I see, you wanna associated the word "Jose" in the dialogue with	0
the fact that then he responded.	0
Someone who's doing  discourse  would wanna  do  that.	0
And so, if we pass out the data to someone else,	0
and it says "speaker- five " there, we  also  have to pass them this little  guide  that says that speaker-five is  Jose,	0
and if were gonna do that we might as well  give them "Jose" say it was "Jose".	0
And that  violates  our  privacy.	0
And that violates our  privacy   issue.	0
Now, I I think that we have these two phases in the in the data, which is the one which is o- our use, University of Washington's use, I_B_M, S_R_I.	1
it  may  be that it's sufficient to not uh change the to not incorporate anonymization yet,	1
but  always,  always in the publications we have to.	1
And I think also, when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world, we  have  to.	0
But I but I don- that's that's a long way from now and and it's a matter of -	0
between now and then of d- of  deciding   how -	0
i- i- it You know, it may be s- that we- we'll need to do something like actually X_ out that part of the um the audio, and just put in brackets "speaker-one".	0
You know, what we could  do  also is have more than one version of  release.  One that's  public	0
and one one that requires licensing.	0
And so the  licensed  one would w- we could it would be a  sticky  limitation.	0
I think that's risky. I think that the public should be the same.	0
You know, like Well, we can talk about that later.	0
I think that when we do that world release, it should be the same.	0
For a bunch of reasons, legal.	0
I I agree with Jane. I I think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort,	1
But I also think a  consistent    licensing   policy is important.	0
Well, one thing to- to take into consideration is	0
um For example, the people who are funding this work,	0
they want this work to get out and be useful for  discourse.  If we all of a sudden  do  this and then release it to the  public  and it's not longer useful for  discourse,	0
Well, depending on how much  editing  we do, you  might  be able to  still have it  useful.	0
because for  discourse  you don't need the  audio.	0
Right? So you could  bleep   out  the names in the  audio.	0
and use the anonymized one through the  transcript.	0
Excuse  me. We we  do  need audio for discourse.	0
But if you release  both  -	0
But, n- excuse me, but you could bleep out just the names.	0
No, but she's saying, from the argument  before,  she wants to be able to  say  if someone said "Jose" in their in their thing, and then connect to so- to what he said later, then you  need  it.	0
Right. But in the  transcript,  you could say, everywhere they said " Jose "	0
replace it with "speaker- seven ".	0
Yeah. But I  I  also  wanna say that people -	0
And then it wouldn't meet match the  audio  anymore.  But it would be still useful for the -	0
But if both of those are publically available -	0
Well, you see? So, it's complicated.	1
And th- and the  other  thing is if if if Liz were here,  what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue, and so,  uh,  yeah.	1
Yeah. I think we have to think about w-	1
how. I think that this can't be decided today.	1
But it's g- but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can	0
I didn't think when I wrote you that  email  I wasn't thinking it was a big can of  worms,  but I guess it  is.	0
Yeah, a lot of these things are.	0
Well it Discourse, you know  Also  I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a  transcript.  It's gonna be looking at a t-	0
You know, and prosod- prosodic stuff is involved, and that means you're going to be listening to the audio, and then you come directly into this confronting this problem.	0
Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do  research  on discourse,	0
and then, we wouldn't have to worry about it.	0
Yeah, we should just market it to non-English speaking countries.	0
Uh, maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own  name.	0
Did you read the paper on Eurospeech?	0
We could have little labels. I I I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again, which is everyone has like "Mister White", "Mister Pink",  "Mister Blue".	0
Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were  reversing  the  syllables?	0
They were di- they- they  had  the  utterances.  and they would  extract  out the  syllables  and they would  play  them  backwards.	0
But so, the syllables were in the same order, with respect to each other, but the acous-	0
Everything was in the  same   order, but they were the individual syll-  syllables were played backwards.	0
And you could  listen  to it,  and it would sound the  same.	0
What did it  sound  like?	0
People had  no  difficulty in- interpreting it.	0
So what we  need  is something that's the  reverse,  that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't  understand  it.	0
Oh, well that's there's an  easy  way to do  that.	0
Jus- jus- just  play  it all  backwards.	0
Oh right. The speech recognizer's totally symmetric, isn't it.	0
What, what does the  speech  recognizer care?	0
Oh, do we do digits? Or ?  What do we do?	0
Let's do digits. Yeah, we we we already missed the party. So.	0
Uh O_K, we'll quickly do digits.	0
Or do we just quit?	0
I think it would be fun sometime to read them with different intonations.	0
like as if you were talking	0
like, "nine eight six eight seven?"	0
Well, you know, in the in the one I transcribed, I did find a couple instances  I found one instance of contrastive stress, where it was like the string had a -	0
li- So it was like "nine eight two four, nine  nine  two four".	0
Oh, really. So they were like looking ahead, huh?	0
Well, they  differed.  I mean, at that  that  session I did feel like they did it more as  sentences.	0
But, um, sometimes people do it as phone numbers.  I mean, I've I	0
am sort of interested in in And sometimes, you know, I s-	0
And I  I  never know. When  I  do it, I -	0
I ask myself what I'm  doing  each time.  and I -	0
Well, I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this	0
They may as well throw in some interesting intonations.	0
Well, except, yeah.  We have the transcript. We have the actual numbers they're reading, so we're not necessarily depending on that. O_K, I'm gonna go off.	0
I  like  your  question  intonation. That's  very  funny. I haven't heard  that  one.	0
