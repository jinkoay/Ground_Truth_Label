Alright.	0
So.	0
So are you -	0
Are we going?	0
It is uh, must be February fifteenth.	0
Yeah.	0
Yu-	0
I think the date's written in there, yep. And actually if everyone could cross out the R_nine next to "Session", and write M_R eleven.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah. We didn't  have  a front-end meeting today.	0
And let's remember also to make sure that one's  gets marked as unread, unused.	0
O_K.	0
M_R eleven.	0
M_R eleven.	0
That sounds like a spy code.	0
Mmm.	0
O_K. So.	0
There's  lots of clicking I'm sure as I'm trying to get this to work  correctly.	0
Agenda.	0
Any agenda  items   today?	0
I wanna talk a little bit about getting -	0
how we're gonna to get people to edit  bleeps,	0
parts of the meeting that they don't want to include.	0
What I've done so far, and I wanna get some opinions on, how to - how to finish it up.	0
O_K.	0
I wanna ask about um,	0
some aud- audio monitoring	0
on some of the  um  well	0
some of the equipment.	0
In particular, the - well	0
uh, that's just what I wanna ask.	0
O_K audio monitoring, Jane.	0
Ba- based on some of the tran- uh - i-	0
In listening to  some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things,	0
and in pact - in fact this one I'm talking on is one of - of the ones that showed up in  one  of the meetings, so I - Mm-hmm. Yeah.	0
Oh really.	0
"Spikes", you mean like uh, instantaneous click type spikes, or - ?	1
Spikes?	0
Clicks.	0
Yeah.	0
Hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Huh.	0
And I don't know what the e- electronics is but.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah. Well, I think it's	0
Touching.	0
uh, it - it could be a number of things. It could be touching and fiddling, and the other thing is that it could - the fact that it's on a wired mike is suspicious. It might be a connector.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
Well maybe -	0
Then we don't really have to talk about that as an - I - I take that off the agenda.	0
You could try an experiment and say "O_K, I'm about to test for spikes", and then wiggle the thing there, and then	0
Yeah.  Right.	0
go and when they go to transcribe it, it could, ask them to come and get you.  "Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there's spikes."	0
Oh that -	0
Well,	0
Um.	0
No I'm just -  @@	0
O_K.	0
I mean,	0
were this a	0
professional audio recording,	0
what we would do -	0
what you would do is - in  testing  it is, you would actually  do  all this wiggling and	0
make sure that - that - that things are not giving that kind of performance.	0
And if they are, then they can't be used.	0
Right.	0
So.	0
Um. Let's see. I guess  I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on	0
uh, recording, transcription  you know, basically you know where we are on the corpus.	0
Good.	0
And then um,	0
the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta-quest, I think, deal is, uh, agendas.	0
So maybe I'll - I'll start with that actually. Uh,	0
um.	0
Andreas brought up	0
the fact that he would  kinda  like to know,	0
if  possible,  what we were gonna be talking about because	0
he's	0
sort of  peripherally  involved to this point,	0
and if there's gonna be a topic about -	0
discussion about something that he	0
uh strongly cares about then he would come and -	0
And I think part of -	0
part  of his motivation with this  is that  he's trying to help us  out,  in the -	0
because of uh	0
the fact that the meetings are - are tending to become	0
reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so,	0
he figures he could help that out by  not  showing - and - and I'm sure help	0
Mmm.	0
out his own time.	0
by not showing up if it's a	0
meeting that he's - he's -	0
So, uh in order -	0
I'd - I think that	0
this is a  wish  on his part. Uh. It's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times	0
uh things come up that are unanticipated and - and -	0
But um,	0
Right.	0
we could  try  anyway, uh,	0
do another try at coming up with the agenda	0
uh, at some point before the meeting,	0
uh, say the day before.	0
Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to  like on Wednesday, or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
You - you wanna volunteer to do that?	0
Sure.	0
O_K.	0
Alright so we'll send out agenda request.	0
Uh.	0
Let me	0
That'll be - I think that'll help -	0
I'll put that on my spare brain or it will not  get done.	0
That'll help a lot, actually.	0
Yeah, I have to tell you for the uh - for the admin meeting that we have, Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting.	0
And uh, she ends up getting the agenda requests uh, uh ten minutes before the meeting. But - but -  But.	0
Uh.	0
But we can  try.	0
Maybe it'll work.	0
Mmm.	0
Yeah.  Maybe.	0
Weirder things have happened.	0
Yeah.	0
I'm wondering if he were to just, uh, specify particular topics, I mean.	0
Maybe we'd be able to meet that request of his a little more.	0
I would - I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there'll be more things of interest to him.	0
Well then -	0
Yeah.	0
Actually it -	0
This - this maybe brings up another topic which is um -	0
So we're done with that topic.	0
The other topic I was thinking of was	1
the sta- status on microphones and channels, and all that.	1
Yeah, actually I - I was going to say we need to  talk about that too.	0
Yeah.	0
Why - why don't we do that.	0
O_K. Um, the new microphones, the  two  new ones are in.	1
Um.  And they are being assembled as we speak, I hope.	1
And I didn't bring my car today so I'm gonna pick them up tomorrow.	0
Um, and then the other  question  I was  thinking  about is -	0
well, a  couple  things. First of all,	1
if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable, we should probably just go ahead and get them.	1
So we'll have to evaluate that when they come in,	1
and get people's opinions on - on what they think of them.	1
Uh-	0
Um, then the  other  question I had is maybe we should get another  wireless.	0
Another wireless setup. I mean it's  expensive,  but it does seem to be  better than the  wired.	0
So how many channels do you get to have	1
in a wireless setup?	1
Um,	1
well,	0
I'm pretty sure that you can daisy-chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless.	1
So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike,	1
possibility of six wireless receivers, and apparently you  can  chain those together.	0
And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes.	1
So, um.	0
And -	0
So let's see we -	0
So, you know it's still, it's fifteen minus six.	0
Right? So we could have up to nine.	0
And right now we can have up to six.	0
Right.	0
And we  have  five, we're getting one more.	0
Yeah.	0
And it's um, about nine hundred dollars for the base station,	0
and then eight hundred per channel.	0
Oh. So yeah so the only -	0
Beyond the mike - the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that's nine hundred dollars.	0
Right.	0
Oh, we should do it.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K, so I'll look into how you daisy-chain them and - and then just go ahead and order them.	0
Yeah.	0
I don't quite understand how that - how that works,. If -	0
So we're not  increasing  the number of channels.	1
No, we're just replacing the wired - the two wired that are still  working,	1
O_K. O_K. I see.	1
along with a couple of the wired that  aren't  working,	1
one  of the wired that's not working,	0
with a wireless.	1
Yeah. Basically we found -	0
Three wireds work, right?	0
I - I guess three wireds work, yeah.	0
Yeah. Yeah.	0
Yeah. But we've had more problems with that.	0
Yep.	0
And that sort of bypasses the whole - [MASK] and all that.	0
Right.	0
And so	0
um,	0
we - we seem to have uh, a reliable way of getting the data in, which is through the ra- Sony radio mikes, as long as we're conscious about the batteries.	0
That seems to be the key	0
Right.	0
Everyone's battery O_K?	0
issue.	0
I checked them this morning, they should be.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
Um,	0
That's the only thing with them. But the quality seems really good and -	0
Um I heard from [MASK] that they're - they're uh very close to getting their, uh setup purchased. They're - they're - they're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf.	1
Well we should talk to them about it because I know that [MASK] is also in the process of looking at stuff,	1
and so, you know, what we should try to keep everyone - on the same page with that.	1
Yeah.	0
[MASK] really?	0
Yeah.	0
Oh.	0
They got sa- apparent-	0
Well,	0
Maybe  this needs to be bleeped out? I have no clue.	0
Uh, I don't know. Probably we shouldn't - probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff.	0
I don't know how much of it's public.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
But anyway there's - there's - there's uh, uh other activities that are going on there and - and uh - and [MASK] So.	0
Um. But - but yeah I thin- I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is - is quite positive with the Sony, uh,  radio-mikes .	0
Right.	0
Now the  one  thing that you  have  said that actually concerns me a little is you're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector,	0
which means some hand-soldering or something, right?	0
Uh, no, we're having the -  them   do  it. So it's so- hand-soldering it, but I'm not doing it.	0
No?	0
Oh.	0
O_K.	0
So, they - they charge  right.	1
Nothing against you and your  hand-soldering  but -	0
You've never  seen  my hand-soldering.	0
But uh,	0
Uh,	0
O_K, so that's being done professionally and -  Yeah.	0
a- as I said they're coming in.	0
I - I mean - Yeah. I mean.	0
Yeah.	0
As professionally as I guess you can get it done.	0
Well,	0
it could - if they do a lot of it, it's -	0
I mean i- it's just their repair shop.	0
Right? Their maintenance people.	0
Well, we'll see what it - it's like. That - tha- that  can  be quite good.	0
Yep.	0
Th- this - Yeah, O_K.	0
Good. Yeah. So let's go with that. Uh,	0
And, I mean we'll see,  tomorrow,  you know, what it looks like.	0
Yeah.	0
So, um,	0
uh,	0
Dave isn't here but he was going to	0
start working on some things with the digits.	0
Uh,	0
so he'll be interested in what's going on with  that.  I guess - Was - the decision last time was that the -	1
the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well?	0
Mm-hmm. Yeah.	1
Has that started, or is that - ?	1
Uh, it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that.	0
Right, so, the decision was that Jane did  not  want the transcribers to be doing any of the  paperwork.  So I did the - all  that  last week.	0
So all the - all the  forms  are now  on the computer.	0
And uh, then I have a bunch of scripts that we'll read those and	0
let the uh  transcribers use different tools. And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So he has a nice set up that they -	0
it w- it will be efficient for them to do that.	0
O_K. So anyway -	0
I - I don't think it'll take too long.	1
So, you know, just uh, a matter of a few days I suspect.	1
So anyway I think we - we have at least one uh, user	0
for the digits once they get done, which will be Dave.	0
Right.	0
O_K.	0
I've already done five or six  sets.	0
So if he wanted to, you know, just have a few to start with, he  could.	0
Yeah, he might - he might be asking -	0
You know, and I also have a bunch of scripts that will, like, generate [MASK]	0
Right.	0
O_K.	0
Uh, is Dave -	0
I don't know if Dave is on the list,	0
if he's invited to these meetings, uh	1
if he knows.	0
I don't tend to get an invitation  myself  for them even.	0
No, no.	0
Uh, we don't have a active one but I'll make sure he's on the list.	0
Yeah.	0
Should we  call  him? I mean is he - d- is he definitely not  available  today?	0
I don't know.	0
Should I call his office and see?	0
Uh, well i- it's uh -	0
He  was  in. Yeah.	0
I mean, he's  still  taking classes, so uh, he may well have conflicts.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, he was in  s-	0
He wasn't there at cof-	0
Yeah, so this might be a conflict for him.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	1
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
Uh, so.	0
Yeah didn't he say his signal-processing class was like	0
I think he has a class. Yeah.	0
Tuesdays and Thursdays?	0
Yeah. He might have.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
You talking about David Gelbart?	0
Oh well, whatever.	0
Yeah.	0
Yes.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, I think he's taking two twenty-five A_ which is now.	0
O_K.	0
So.	0
Yeah. O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
So, that's why we're not seeing him. O_K.	0
Uh, transcriptions, uh, beyond the digits, where we are, and so on.	1
O_K.	0
Um -	0
And the - and the recordings also, just where we are.	0
Yeah.	0
Well,	1
so um, should we - we don't wan- wanna do the recording status first, or - ?	1
Well, we have about thirty-two hours  uh	1
as of,	0
I guess a week and a half ago, so we probably now have about thirty- five  hours.	0
And - and that's - that's uh - How much of that is digits?	0
It's uh - that's including digits, right?	0
That's including digits. I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits.	1
So -	0
Yeah.	0
So anyway there's at least probably thirty hours, or something of -	0
There's got to be more than thirty hour - i- it couldn't - of -	1
Of - of  non-digits?	1
Mmm.	0
Of non-digits.	0
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the digits don't take up that much time.	1
Yeah, yeah.	0
O_K.	0
O_K, and the transcribers h- I, uh, don't have the exact numbers, but I	1
think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh, transcribing from them right now.  The next step is to - that I'm working on is to insure that the data are  clean  first,	1
and then  [MASK]  What I mean by  clean  is that they're spell-checked, that the mark-up is consistent all the way throughout, and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that	1
uh,  Liz  requested in terms of um, um  in terms of having a s- a	0
systematic handling of numbers, and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about.	1
Um, for example, i- they'll say uh "ninety-two". And you know, so how - you could -	0
Nine two, right.	0
e- Exactly. So if you just say "nine two", the - there are many s- ways that could have been expressed. An- and I just had them -	0
I - I mean, a certain number of them  did  put the words down,	0
but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by, um, a gloss th- and things.	0
You know, Jane?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um, one suggestion and you may already be doing this, but	0
I've noticed in the past that when I've gone	0
through transcriptions and you know in - in order to build lexicons and things,	0
if you um, just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them,	0
a lot of times just scanning down that list you'll find a lot of  inconsistencies and mis-	0
Misspelled.	0
Yeah.	0
You're talking about [MASK] and I use those too.	0
Y- you mean just uh  on each - on each line there's a one word right?	0
It's one token from the - from the corpus.	0
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah, those are e- extremely efficient and I- and I - I agree that's a very good use of it.	0
Oh so you already have that, O_K.	0
Well that's - that's a way - that's - You know, the  spell-check	1
basically  does  that but - but in addition - yes, that's - that's exactly the strategy  I  wanna do in terms of locating these things which are	1
you know [MASK] which aren't in the lexicon.	0
Mm-hmm. Cuz a lot of times they'll appear  next  to each other,	0
Exactly.  And then you ca- then you can do a s-	0
Yeah.	0
and uh, i- in alphabetized  lists,  they'll appear  next  to each other	0
Absolutely. I agree.	0
and - and so it makes it easier.	0
That's a very good - that's a very good uh, suggestion.	0
And that was - that's  my  strategy for handling a  lot  of these things, in terms of things that need to be  glossed.  I didn't get to that point but -	0
So there are numbers, then there are acronyms, and then um, there's a - he- she wants the uh, actually a -	1
an explicit marker of what type of comment this is, so i- curly b- inside the curly brackets I'm gonna put either	1
[MASK] for vocalized, like cough or like laugh or whatever,	1
[MASK] for door-slam,	1
Right.	0
Oh that's great.	0
I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most - ha- most efficiently handled by uh - by a - a filter. That was what I was  always  planing on. So that, you know you get a whole long list -  exactly  what  you're  saying,	0
you get a whole list of things that say "curly bracket  laugh  curly bracket",	0
Mm-hmm.	0
then y- you know it's - it's - You - you risk less error if you handle it by a filter,	0
than if you have this transcriber ch- laboriously typing in  sort of [MASK] so man-	0
Yeah.	0
So many ways that error prone.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
So, um,	1
um I'm - I'm going to convert that via a filter, into these tagged uh, subcategorized comments,	1
and same thing with you know,  we see  you get a subset	0
when you do what  you're  saying, you end up with a s- with uh, you're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens and you can um, have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes. But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand, because, you know I mean, jus-	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
You don't know what they could be.	0
Yeah now [MASK]  but uh there are things that are not so well known, in - or - or have variant - u- u- uses like the numbers you can say "nine two" or you can say "ninety-two", and uh	0
Yeah.	0
So how are you doing the -	0
I'd handle the numbers individually.	0
How are you doing the uh, acronyms so if I say [MASK] what would it appear on the transcript?	1
It would be separate - The letters would be separated in space and potentially they'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e- but I'm not sure if that's necessary,  clarifying  what it is, so gloss of  whatever.	1
O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
I don't know if that's really necessary to do that.	0
Maybe it's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is	0
uh, a step away from i- indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there, and indicating why they're there to indicate that it's uh  the	0
Mm-hmm.	0
you know,  uh enumerated, or i- it's not a good way of saying - but it's - it's the  specific uh way of stating these - these letters.	0
Right. So it sounds good.	0
And so anyway, the clean - those are those things and then [MASK]	0
And at  that  point then it's ready for use by Liz and Don.	0
But that's been my top priority - beyond [MASK] the next step is to work on tightening u	1
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
And uh,  Thilo  had a - e- e- a breakthrough with this - this last week in terms of getting the channel-based um	1
uh s- s- [MASK] um, up and running and I haven't - I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I'm working s- re- this is my top priority -	1
I actually gave	0
Have you also been doing spot checks, Jane?	0
Oh   yes.  Well you see that's part of the cleaning process. I spent	0
Okay, good.	0
um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by  two  of our transcribers,	1
Oh good. Good.	0
and I went through it last night, it's - it's almost spooky how similar these are, word for word. And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I - I left them discretion at commas.	1
Right.	0
Uh - and so because it's not part of our st- of our ne-  needed  conventions.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And um,	0
and - so they'll be a difference in  commas,  but it's word-by-word the  same,	0
in - in  huge  patches of the data. And I have t- ten minute stretch where I can - where I can show that. And - and  sometimes  it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon, and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech. So	0
um, the one i- i- the colloquial speech person picked up "gobbledy-gook". And the other one didn't. And on  this  side, this one's picking up things like [MASK] and the one that's good on the sp- o- on th- the vocabulary on the uh colloquial  didn't.	0
Hmm.	0
Right.	0
When - for the person who missed "gobbledy-gook" what did they put?	0
It was an interesting approximation, put in parentheses, cuz I have this convention that, i- if they're not sure what it was, they put it in parentheses.	0
Oh.	0
So they tried to approximate it, but it was -	0
Oh good.	0
it was spelled G_A_B_B_L -	0
Sort of how it sounds.	0
Yes. More of an attempt to - I mean apparently it was very  clear  to her that these - the- a- this - this was a  sound  - these are the  sounds,  but -	0
Yeah.	0
It was a technical term that she didn't recognize,	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah. But she knew that she didn't know it. Maybe it was a technical ter- exactly. But she - even though her  technical  perception is just really - uh you know I've - I'm tempted to ask her if she's taken any	0
courses in this area or if she's taken cognitive science courses then cuz [MASK] and - oh she has some things that are - oh	0
Right.	0
Hmm.	0
And some of these are rather  uh unexpected.	0
Obscure, yeah.	0
But ch- ten solid uh - m- ch- s- chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data. And um -	0
And - and again the  main  track that you're working with is elev- eleven hours? Is that right?	0
Yes exactly.	0
Yeah, O_K.	0
And that's part of this -	0
Eleven hours.	0
Is that - is that - that including digits?	0
Yes it is. Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
So let's say roughly  ten hours or so of -	0
I mean it's probably more than that but - but with - of - of non-digits.	0
It'd be more than that because I - my recollection is the minutes - that da- digits don't take more than half a minute. Per person.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
But um  the - the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape,	0
Oh, I see.	0
But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet. So they're still working - some of them are - Two of them are still working on completing that.	0
Oh, I see.	0
Yeah.	0
Boy,  they're  moving right  along.	0
Yeah. They  are.  Mm-hmm. They're very efficient.	0
Yeah.	0
There're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others. Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So what - what - what's the deal with - with your -	0
The channel u- thing?	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, it's just uh, I ran the recognizer -  uh,  [MASK] on different channels and,	1
it's just in uh - in this new multi-channel format and output, and	1
Oh, I see.	0
I just gave one - one meeting to - to Liz who wanted to - to try it for - for the recognizer	0
as uh, apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech, which took too much memory or whatever,	1
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
and so  she - she will try that I think and -   I'm - I'm working on it. So, I hope -	0
Is this anything different than [MASK] you were using before?	0
Yeah.	0
No.	0
Uh,	0
I  mmm, use some - some different features but not - not - The basic thing is [MASK]	1
Mm-hmm.	0
So there's still no -	0
no knowledge using different channels at the same time. You know what I mean?	0
There is some, uh as the energy is normalized across channels yeah.	0
Across all of them. O_K.	0
So. But basically that's one of the main changes.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
What are some of the other features? Besides the	0
energy? You said you're trying some different features, or something.	0
Oh I just uh -  Mmm,	0
I just use um our loudness-based things now as they - before there were - they were some in - in the log domain and I - I changed this to the -	0
Cu- Cube root?	0
to the -	0
Yeah.	0
To -	0
No, I changed this to the - to the - to the loudness thingy with the - with the how do you call it? I'm not sure.	0
Hmm.	0
Ah.	0
With the, uh -	0
Fletcher Munson?	0
No.	0
I'm not sure about the term.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
Uh, I'll look it up.  And say it to you.	0
Yeah, alright.	0
Uh, O_K, and - Yeah. That's - that's basically the - the - the thing.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah, and I - and I tried t- to normalize uh -	1
uh the features, there's loudness and modified loudness, um, within one channel,	1
because they're,	1
yeah to - to be able to distinguish between foreground and  background  speech.	1
And it works quite well. But, not always.	1
Uh-huh.	0
Uh-huh.	0
So.	0
O_K.	0
Good.	0
Um, let's see.	0
I think the uh -	0
Were - were you basically done with the transcription part?	0
So I guess the next thing is this uh - bleep editing.	1
Right. So the -	0
The  idea  is that we need to have - We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting	1
to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want. So I've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages,	1
uh  with  the transcription in it so that they can click on  them   and  piece   - pieces and they can scroll through and read them, and then they can  check  on each one if they want it excluded.	0
And then, it's a  form,  H_T_M_L form, so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded.	0
And so, uh, some of the  questions  on this is what do we do about the privacy issue.	0
Yeah.	0
And so I thought about this a  little  bit and I think the  best  way to do it is every participant will have a password, a  single  password. Each  person  will have a single password, user name and password.	0
And then each  meeting,  we'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it.	0
And that way each  person  only has to remember one password.	0
I - I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed. I mean if people have -	0
Uh, I mean, for  me  I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it.	0
And then  um  if I thought it was O_K, I'd say "it's O_K".	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And, I -	0
uh - I mean it depends how this really ends up working out, but I guess my thought was that the	0
occasion of somebody wondering whether something was O_K or not and needing to listen to it	0
was gonna be extremely rare.	0
Right, I mean so th- th- th- the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for  other reasons.	0
O_K.	0
And so that - that's a minor part of it, I just wanted some web interface so that people - you didn't actually have to send everyone the text.	0
So m- what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become  ready,	0
um  I would take them, and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or  contact  them using the contact method they wanted,	0
and just uh,  tell  them, "here's the web page",	0
um, "you need a password". So th- th- question number one is how do we distribute the passwords,	0
and question number  two  is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it.	0
That's -	0
I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say	0
"here is a - here is -"	0
I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but - but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper,	0
that said, uh, "here's what was said in this transcription is it O_K with you?	0
and if it  is,  here's this  other  sheet of paper that you sign that says that it's O_K". And then they'd hand it back to you.	0
I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide.	0
But certainly  I  wouldn't want a printout. These are  big,  and I would much rather be	0
ha- be able to just sit and leaf through it.	0
You find it easier to go through a large - I mean how do you read books?	0
Well I certainly read books by hand. But for something like this, I think it's easier to do it on the web.	0
Really?	0
I mean, it -	0
Cuz you're gonna get, you know, if I - I'm - I'm in a  bunch  of meetings and I don't wanna get a  stack  of these. I wanna just be able to go to - go to the web site  and visit it as I want.	0
Going to a web site is easy, but flipping through a hundred pounds - a hundred pages of stuff is  not  easy on the web.	0
Well, I don't think it's that much harder than, paper.	0
I have one question. So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the  transcript?  Because I - I do think that there's a benefit to being able to hear the	0
Really?	0
So.	0
tone  of voice and the -	0
So here's the way I was imagining it, and maybe I'm wrong, but the way I imagined it was that	1
Yeah.	0
um, the largest set of people is gonna go "oh yeah, I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead, where's the - where's the release?"	1
And then there'll be a  subset  of people, right? - O_K there's - I mean think of who it is we've been recording mostly. O_K there'll be a  subset  of people,	1
Yeah.	0
who um, will say uh "well, yeah, I really would like to see that." And for them,	1
the easiest way to flip through, if it's a  really   large   document,	1
I mean unless you're  searching.   Searching,  of course, should be electronic, but if you're not - so if you provide some  search  mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that, but see then we're getting more elaborate with this thing.	1
Yeah.	0
Um	0
if - if uh	0
you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really, really long document, I mean whenever I've had a  really,  really long document that it was sitting on the web, I've always ended up printing it out.	0
I mean, so it's - it's - I mean, you - you're - you're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time, you wanna figure you have a train ride,	0
and there's all these situations where - where I -	0
I mean, this is how I was imagining it, anyway. And then I figured,	0
that out of  that  group, there would be a subset who would go "hmm you know I'm really not sure about this section here,"	0
and then  that  group would need it -	0
S- It seems like i- if I'm right in that,	0
it seems like you're setting it up for	0
the  most  infrequent case, rather than for the most  frequent  case.	0
So that uh, now we have to worry about privacy, we have to worry about all these passwords, for different people	0
Well, no fre- for the most -	0
For the most frequent case they just say  "it's O_K" and then they're done.	0
And I think  almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
The other thing too is it seems like - Go ahead.	0
Um,	0
yeah, that's true.	0
I mean, cuz you don't  have  to visit the web page if you don't want to.	0
Yeah.	0
I guess - Yeah, I guess we don't need their signature. I guess an email O_K is alright.	0
Oh that was another thing I - I had  assumed  that we didn't need their signature, that it - that an email approval was sufficient.	0
But  I don't actually know.	0
Are - are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking?	1
Yes.	0
I also - mm-hmm.	0
If someone feels strongly enough about it,	1
then I - I - I think they  should  be allowed to do that.	1
Uh	1
So that means other people are editing what you say?	1
Yeah.	0
I don't know about that.	1
I don't know if I  like  that.	0
Well, the only other choice is that the person would say "no, don't distribute this meeting at  all ", and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say "don't distribute it at all".	0
But th-	0
what they signed in the consent form,	0
was something that said you can use  my  voice.	0
Well, but if -	0
Right?	0
if someone is having a conversation, and you only bleep out one  side  of it, that's not sufficient.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, but that's  our  decision then. Right?	0
Um, I don't  think  so.	0
I mean, because if I  object  to the conversation. If I  say	0
I  think it is.	1
"we were having a conversation, and I consider that conversation private,"	0
and I consider that your  side  of it is  enough  for other people to infer, I wanna be able to bleep out your side.	0
The - I agree that the consent forms were - uh, I cons- agree with what Adam's saying, that  um,	0
the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe- whether they said them or didn't say them.	0
I see.	0
And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l- of the l- I'm not a law- lawyer, but it strikes me that  uh, we wouldn't want someone to say "oh yes, I was a little concerned about it but  it was too hard to access".	0
O_K, well, if that's what it said.	0
So I think it's kind of nice to have this facility to  listen  to it. Now - in terms of like editing it by  hand,  I mean I think it's - i- some people  would  find that easier to specify the  bleep  part	0
by having a document they edited. But - but it seems to me that sometimes um,	0
you know i- if a person had a bad day, and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like, you know it's nice - it's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was O_K.	0
I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it.	0
Um  I mean it's also a mixture of people, I mean some people are r-	0
Um.	0
do their work primarily by sitting at the computer, flipping around the web, and others do  not.	0
Others would consider it - this uh - a -	0
Yep.	0
a set of skills that they would have to gain.	0
You know? It depends on what meetings.	0
Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former.	0
That's true.	0
So far.	0
So.	0
In the meetings  so  far, yeah.	0
Yep.	0
But we're trying to expand this, right?	0
So I - I - I actually think that paper is the more universal thing.	0
Right.	0
And that -	0
Mm-hmm. Yeah.	0
Well, but if they want to print it out that's alright. I think everyone in the meeting can access the web.	0
No, I think  we  have to be able to print it out. It's not just if  they  want to print it out. I - I think -	0
O_K, so does that mean that I can't use email?	0
Or what?	0
Cuz you could send it through email you're thinking.	0
I - I th- well - we - there was this -	0
Well, I don't think I - well I don't think we can send the  text  through email because of the privacy issues.	0
Good. For security? Yeah, O_K good. Good point.	0
No.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Um.	0
@@	0
So giving them, you think a web site to say, "if you wanna print it out here it is", is not sufficient?	0
Yeah.	0
I-	0
Certainly for everybody who's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient. I'm just wondering about -	0
Yeah, I'm just thinking for people that that's not sufficient for, what - the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and  hand  it to them.	0
You could mail it to them. Get an- a mailing address.	0
Yeah.	0
Equivalent.	0
But -	0
But I think it's easier to drop in the box.	0
Just put the button on - on the web page which say "please send me the - the scripts".	0
Oh that's interesting.	0
That's right.	0
Yeah.	0
What um - When you display it on the web page, what are - what are you showing them? Utterances, or - ?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And so can they bleep within an utterance?	0
No. Whole utterances only.	0
Whole utterances.	0
And that was just convenience for my sake, that it's uh, uh	0
it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at [MASK]	0
Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand.	0
There's another aspect to this which maybe -	0
is part of why this is bothering me.	0
Um, I think you're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this.	0
I mean that's why I did the web form, because for  me  that would be my most convenient.	0
Mmm.	0
I - I - I understand. I think  that's  the bad idea.	0
I know where you're going.	0
Oh.	0
See because you're gon- you're - uh -  Really.  You're gonna end up with all these little patchy things, whereas  really  what we want to do is have the - the - the  bias  towards letting it go.	0
Because nob- you know it -	0
There was a - one or twi- once or twice, in the re- in the meetings we've heard, where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by,	0
but  overall  people are talking about technical topics. Nobody's gonna get hurt. Nobody's being l- libeled.	0
You know, this is - this - we're - we're covering - We're playing the lawyer's game, and we're playing- we're - we're - we're looking for the extreme case.	0
If we  really  orient it towards that extreme case, make it  really  easy, we're gonna end up encouraging a headache.	0
That - I think that's -	0
I'm sort of psyching  myself  out here, I - I'm trying to - uh - but I - I think that's -	0
I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu- much of a headache, bleeped out. So.	0
Well, it's - but i-	0
I think what Morgan's saying is the easier it is, the more is gonna be bleeped.	0
And - and it  really  depends on what kind of research you're doing.	0
I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there's a bunch of stuff in there  that's missing from the dialogue.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
You know, it depends on the kind of research they're doing, but it might be, uh  it might be really a - a pain.	0
Yeah.	0
And, you know where it's  really  gonna hurt somebody, in some way - the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about,	1
we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out. But I  really  think we wanna make it the  rare  incidence.	1
And - and uh, I  am  just a little worried about making it so easy for people to  do,  and so much  fun!	1
that they're gonna go through and bleep out stuff.	0
So much fun.	0
and they can bleep out stuff they don't  like  too, right from somebody else, as you say, you know, so "well I didn't like what he said."	0
Well I don't see  any  way of avoiding that. I mean, we  have  to provi- we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like.	0
Yeah.	0
So that the -	0
No, no, I - I - I don't -	0
The  only  question is -	0
You- you've talked me into  that,  but I - I just think that we should make it harder to do.	0
The problem is if it's harder for them it's also harder for me.	0
Whereas this web interface, I just get email, it's all formatted, it's all ready to go and I can just insert it.	0
So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it.	0
Well I guess -	0
So - so - so I'm sorry - so -	0
Yeah. Hmm.	0
so -	0
So maybe this is a s- a way out of it.	0
You've provided something that's useful for you to do -	0
handle, and useful for someone else if they need it.	0
But	0
Well -	0
I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh, they get access to this if they really need it.	0
So you're saying the - the sequence would be more like	0
first Adam goes to the contact lists, contacts them via whatever their preferred method is, to see if they  want  to review the meeting.	0
Right.	0
And then if they  don't,  you're done. If they  do,  then he provides them access to the - the web site.	0
Well, to some extent I have to do that  anyway  because as I said we have to distribute  passwords.	0
W- w-	0
Or  - a printed-out form.	0
There's - there -	0
y-	0
So,	0
but you don't necessarily  have  to distribute passwords is what I'm saying.	0
Well, but -	0
So -	0
what I'm  saying  is that I can't just email them the password because that's not secure.	0
Only  if they want it.	0
No, no, no. But you aren't necessarily giving them -	0
So they have to  call  me and ask.	0
Right.	0
But - we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at  all.	0
Well, we do because of privacy. We can't just make it openly available on the web.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
No, no. You're missing the point.	0
We're - We're trying i-	0
We're trying to make it less of an obvious just l- l- l- l-	0
uh fall off a log, to  do  this.	0
Not everyone gets a password,	0
unless they ask for it. Yeah.	0
Right?	0
So th- so what  I  would see, is that	0
first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the - not just for fun,	0
O_K? but to - to check this	0
for uh things that they're worried about having said or if they're willing to just send an approval of it, at - from their memory.	0
Um - and, uh, and we should think carefully actually we should review - go through how that's worded, O_K?	0
Then, if someone uh - wants to review it,	0
uh, and I know you don't like this, but I'm offering this as a suggestion, is that - is that we then give them a print out.	0
And then if they say that "I have a potential problem with these things,"  then,	0
you - you say "O_K well you might wanna hear this in context to s- think if you need that," you issue them a password, i- in the -	0
But the - the problem with what you're suggesting is it's not just inconvenient for them, it's inconvenient for me.	0
Because that means multiple contacts every time - for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything.	0
I would much  prefer  to have all be automatic, they visit the web site if they  want  to. Obviously they don't have to.	0
I know you'd  prefer  it, but the proble- we have - there's a  problem  with it.	0
Yeah. So I think you're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that's gonna happen.	0
I'm also concerned about the spirit of the - of the informed consent thing. Cuz I think if they feel	0
that uh, it's - I th- I th- You know, if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect,	0
then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that, um,	0
but - but they might be able to argue "oh well it was cumbersome, and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down". So it could that the burden would come back onto us. So I'm a little bit worried about uh, making it harder for them, from the legal standpoint.	0
Well you can go too far in that direction, and you need to find somewhere between I think, because -	0
Yeah.	0
It seems to me that sending them email,	0
Uh-huh.	0
saying "if you have an O_- O_K reply to this email and say O_K,	0
If you have a  problem  with it contact me and I'll give you a password",	0
seems like is a perfectly, reasonable compromise. And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves.	0
Or we could print it up for  them,   I mean we could offer that - but - but there's uh, another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form,	0
Yeah.	0
um, my impression is that they - that we offered them at the very least that they definitely  would  have access to the transcript. And - and I ha- I don't know that there's a chance of really skipping that stage.	0
Yeah.	0
I mean I - I thought that you were - Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it's -	0
Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean, that - having it right? It just means they have the  right  to have it.	0
Having it. Well the in - the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it, so.	1
Giving it to  them.   O_K.	0
Alright. Fine. O_K. Fair enough.	0
Yeah.	0
Sh- sh- well I could - I'm closer. I could -	0
D- you want me to grab one?	0
Yeah, but you're wired aren't you?	0
Yeah. That is true.	0
Um.	0
Yeah, I mean I don't wanna  fool  them,	0
I don't know -	0
I just meant that e- every - ev- any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a - a bias that is presented, right? of - and -	0
Oh yeah yeah - oh I know.	0
Yeah that's true. Yeah.	0
"If you agree to participate you'll have the opportunity to have anything ex-  anything  excised, which you would prefer not to have included in the data set."	1
Yeah.	0
"Once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r- larger research community. There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you'd prefer to have excised from the database, and they will m- be removed both from the transcript and the recording."	1
Hmm.	0
Well that's more open than I realized.	0
Well, I mean it -	0
I -	0
The  one  question is definitely clear with  anything  as opposed to just what you said.	0
Yeah.	0
Tha- that's true. That's more severe,	0
Yeah,  uh  no that - it - tha- that's right.	0
but the next one says the transcript will be around. And it doesn't  really say we'll send it to you, or wi- it'll be available for you on the web, or anything.	0
I think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them.	0
I- I -	0
At least  it more often. Yeah.	0
It means also we don't have to g-	0
To  give  it to them. I mean like - like Morgan was saying they - they -	0
They just have to make sure that it is available to them.	0
It's available to  them   if they ask for it.	0
Yeah, O_K, so. wh- um - I think I have an idea that may be sat- may satisfy both you and me in this which is,	0
um, it's a - it - we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded.	0
So I - I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre- it gives very, I mean nothing  hidden,  v- very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data.	1
Right.	0
That - that we really would  rather  it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out, that it would be better for, um, our, uh, field	1
Good.	0
if that is the  case.  But if you  really  think something is gonna -	0
And I don't think there's anything in the legal aspects that - that is hurt by our expressing that bias.	0
Great. Great, great. Yeah. I agree.	0
And then - then my concern about - which - you know you might be right, it may be it was just paranoia on my part, uh but people just -	0
See I'm  @@  worried about this interface so much fun  that people start bleeping stuff out	0
just as - just because they  can.   Yeah.	0
It's just a check box next to the text, it's not any fun at all.	0
Well I don't know. I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out. You know.   I -	0
Well, but they won't  get  that feedback.	0
All - no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the  time.  It just sends me -	0
Oh they won't?	0
Oh good. So you haven't made it so much fun.	0
Right.	0
Oh good. O_K,	0
It just sends me the time intervals. And then at some point I'll incorporate them all and put bleeps.	1
I mean I don't wanna have t- ha- do that yet until we actually release the data because um, then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we're already short on disk space.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
So I - I wanna - I - just keep the  times  until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it.	0
O_K.	0
Alright, so I think -	0
Yeah so if we have if - i-	0
Again let's you know, sort of	1
circulate the - the wording on each of these things and get it  right,  but -	1
Well since you seem to feel heart- uh,  strongest  about it, would you like to do the first pass?	1
but -	0
O_K.	0
Uh, fair enough.	0
Al-	0
Turn about is fair play,  Sorry.	0
Also it- ther- there is this other question, the legal question that - that Adam's raised, uh about whether we need a concrete signature, or email c- i- suffices or whatever and I don't know how that works. i- There's something down there about "if you agree to -"	0
Yeah.	0
I'm - I'm - I'm - I thought - I - I thought about it with one of my background processes and I - uh it's - uh it's uh, it's fine to do the email.	0
I don't think so.	0
Ah.	0
Fine. Good. O_K.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah because thi- th- they're signing here that they're agreeing to the paragraph which says	0
"you'll be given an opportunity."	0
Yeah. And -	0
And so I  don't  think they need another signature.	0
Well and furthermore I - it's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that - that uh if it's - if it's that sort of thing where you're	0
you're saying uh "O_K I agree, we want eighty hours of this person at such-and-such amount, and I agree that's O_K,"	0
uh if it's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it's often done in email now so it's - it's O_K.	0
Right.	0
Great.	0
Um.	0
So I guess I probably should at the  minimum,	0
think about how to present it in a printed form.	0
I'm not really sure what's best with that. The problem is a lot of  them   are really short,	0
Well -	0
and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line.	0
But I don't know how else to do it.	0
Well I s-	0
I also have this - I - I think it's nice you have it uh, viewab- her-  hearable on the - on the web for those who might wonder about	0
um, the non- nonverbal side, I mean I - I agree that our bias should be as - as expressed here, and - but	0
I - I think it's nice that a person could check. Cuz sometimes you know you - the words on a - on the page, come out soun- sounding different in terms of the  social dynamics if they hear it. And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people  you know, shouldn't borrow trouble. What it comes down to but -	0
Hmm.	0
