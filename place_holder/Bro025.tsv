Mm-hmm.	0
So that's kind of an argument for  that.	0
We  do  still, however, have to consider its latency. So the issue is - is, um,	1
for instance, could we have [MASK] that only looked at the  past?	0
Right.	0
Um, what we've done in  uh  - in the past is to use [MASK] uh, to transform,	0
um, all of the features that we use. So this is done early on. This is essentially,	0
um, um - I  guess  it's - it's more or less like a spee- [MASK] here - right? - where we're just kind of creating	0

uh, that - that have some of the noise removed.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um, after that we still do a mess of other things to - to produce a bunch of features.	0
Right.	0
And then those features are not now currently transformed	0
by [MASK]	0
And then the - the way that we had it in our proposal-two before, we had [MASK]  and  we had	0
[MASK] which I guess you - you actually	0
Yeah. Yeah. Right.	0
but they were not, uh, processed through [MASK] And Stephane's idea with that, as I recall, was that	0
you'd have one part of [MASK] that was very discriminant and another part that  wasn't,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh, which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when, uh, the testing set was quite different than what you'd trained [MASK] for.	0
So, um, all of that is - is, uh - still seems like a good idea.	0
The thing is now we know some other constraints. We can't have unlimited amounts of latency.	1
Uh, y- you know, that's still being debated by the - by people in Europe but,	1
uh, no matter  how  they end up there, it's not going to be  unlimited  amounts, so we have to be a little conscious of that.	1

But I think, you know, at this point our major concern is making the performance better and - and, um,	0
if, uh, something  has  to take a little longer in latency in order to do it that's  you know, a secondary issue.	0

I don't remember what you said  the answer to my, uh, question earlier. Will you -	0
will you train the net on -  after  you've done [MASK]	0
This is a different net.	0
Oh.	0
So we have [MASK] which is like neur- that's [MASK]	0

Oh, you're talking about [MASK] O_K. I see.	0

Yeah, but we need [MASK] also. So it's, like,	0
where do we want to put [MASK]	0
Uh, it's like -	0
Can you use the same net to do both, or - ?	0
For -	0
Can you use the same net that you - that  I  was talking about to do [MASK]	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh, it actually comes at v- at the very end.	0
So the net - the final net - I mean, which is [MASK] -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
so that actually comes after a chain of, like, [MASK] plus  everything.  So it's, like, it takes a long time to get a decision out of it. And -	0
and you can actually do it for  [MASK] but	0
Mm-hmm.	0
not for [MASK]- f-	0
You see, the idea is that the, um,	0
initial  decision to - that - that you're in silence or speech happens pretty quickly.	0
Oh, O_K. Cuz that's used by some of these other - ? Oh, O_K.	0
Hmm.	0
And that -	0
Yeah. And that's sort of fed forward, and - and you say "well, flush everything, it's not speech anymore".	0
I see.	0
Yeah.	0
I thought that was  only  used for doing [MASK] later on.	0
Um, it is used,	0
uh - Yeah, it's only used f-	0
Well, it's used for [MASK]	0
Um, it's used for end of utterance because, you know, there's -	0
Mmm.	0
if you have  more than five hundred milliseconds of - of - of nonspeech then you figure it's end of utterance or something like that. So,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um.	0
And it seems important for, like, [MASK]	0
Um.	0
We don't want to update the mean and variance during silen- long silence portions.	0
Um.	0
So it - it has to be done before	0
Oh.	0
I see.	0
this mean and variance normalization.	0
Um.	0
Um.	0
Yeah. So probably [MASK] and - and maybe testing ou	0
I mean, keeping the same  method  but - but, uh,	0
seeing if you cou-  but, um  [MASK] could be improved.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Those are sort of related issues.	0
It probably makes sense to move from there.	0
And then, uh,	0
later on in the month I think we wanna start including [MASK] at the end.	0
Um.	0
O_K. Anything else?	0
The Half Dome was great.	0
Good.	0
Yeah. You didn't - didn't fall.	0
That's good.	0
Well, yeah.	0
Our e- our effort would have been  devastated   if you guys had   run into problems.	0
So, Hynek is coming back next week, you said?	0
Yeah, that's the plan.	0
Hmm.	0
@@  I guess the week after he'll be, uh, going back to Europe, and so we wanna -	0
Is he in Europe right now or is he up at - ? Oh.	0
No, no. He's - he's - he's dropped into the U_S. Yeah. Yeah.	0
Hmm.	0

Uh, Barry, you just got through your  quals, so I don't know if you  have much to say. But, uh.	1

we don't have too much trouble recognizing synthetic speech since we create it in the first place. So, it's -	1
