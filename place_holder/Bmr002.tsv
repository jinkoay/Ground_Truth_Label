O_K. So.	0
I think that's recording now.	0
O_K, I'm on -	0
I'm talking on mike  two.	0
So,	0
Which channel is that?	0
Um,	0
do it again.	0
Mike number  two,  I'm talking right  now  on?	0
That's uh -	0
Mike  number two?	0
That's in channel one.	0
Channel  one?	0
Is that channel  one  or channel  zero?	0
Channel one.	0
Channel one.	0
Let me make sure .	0
There are no -	0
There's only one connection element.	0
which is  zero-based  or  one-based?	0
It's zero-based.	0
O_K, So we're  not  going to do that. O_K.	0
Unfortunately the mikes are   you know  -	0
This - this has the disadvantage of needing to put the numbers on the mikes.	0
off  by one.	0
Consistently not equal to the numbers - numbers on the channels.	0
Right.	0
Wh- that's why I wanted to write it  down,	0
but	0
Dan just  doesn't  want to do that.	0
Well	0
Well, you can write it down.	0
I mean   Write down whatever you like.	0
Thank you.	0
Write down that poem.	0
Let us know when you're done, though	0
cuz we want to start the meeting.	0
Now, how do you do the mike?	0
O_K, now, that means - if  I'm  going to be standing in  there  looking,	0
I keep getting it in my nose.	0
I  don't  know.	0
You can do whatever - any way you like.	0
Oh!	0
Oh!  This  is good.	0
then someone  else  has to write them  down.	0
Oh! I  like  this.	0
because I won-	0
The  weird  thing is that	0
I like this.	0
um it means that it	0
O_K.	0
varies when you move your head around but -	0
Fine.	0
I think it's probably the better solution.	0
Let's not try  to do anything too  easy.	0
I  like this, this is  much  more comfortable.	0
O_K?	0
Testing.	0
I could have it more at the  midline.	0
Boy!  It's  very    adjustable  now.	0
So go ahead .	0
I'm  on number  four.	0
Do we have the numbers?	0
the- the sheets, that we did from last time? so we can do them again?	0
Can -	0
So we can do them again? Yeah.	0
Yep.	0
They're  in the folder right there.	0
Great.	0
May I pass the folder to Dan?	0
You  may.	0
O_K.	0
So,  Jane,  can you  talk  into your  mike?  You said it's mike  four?	1
I'm mike - I'm on mike four.	1
and it's a very nice microphone,	0
Well, hmm,	0
very modern.	0
I'm  glad  you  like  it.	0
I like it very much.	0
@@  Uh	1
Eric,  what  mike  are you?	1
I'm on channel one -	0
Mike one -	0
Mike  one, channel  zero,  probably.	0
Looks like it. S- talk again?	0
Channel  zero.	0
Thank you.	0
I'm on uh	0
mike  three.	0
This is mike  three,	0
coming in here.	0
It's moving around as I move my head	0
backwards and forwards.	0
So that's just the way it goes. That's life.	0
That's just what it does.	0
O_K.	0
You didn't get the s- head restraint with your system?	0
That's right.	0
Head restraint system?	0
I did modify my-	0
my mike uh distance from my	0
speaking  apparatus.	0
Um, can you  do taps on the P_D_As?	0
Slightly.	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
and the	0
P_Z_Ms?  And you have to actually check what the nu-	0
P_Z_Ms? or -  or  not  P_Z_Ms?	0
The-	0
Start  with P_Z_Ms.	0
Because  this  is P_Z_M number  three.	0
Thank you.	0
Let's list them in order.	0
O_K.	0
P_Z_M number three was the furthest away.	0
This is the next one in, which is P_Z_M number four,	0
apparently.	0
I can't tell.	0
P_Z-	0
What- Can you - can you see  other  stuff happening?	0
Yep.	0
This is P_Z_M number  four.	0
Thanks.	0
O_K.	0
That's  a good way.	0
This is P_Z_M  two.	0
F_	0
Thank you.	0
And this is P_Z_M one.	0
which is closest to the machine room.	0
Which -	0
Should I draw a map?	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
I mean	0
And P_D_A,  left, right?	0
I don't know.	0
It's all hopeless.	0
This is uh one side of P_D_A, I guess.	0
We could actually  give  these sides  names,  right?	0
This would be  left,   wouldn't  it.	0
I don't  see  anything.	0
I know,  but I'm just   asking.	0
Huh-uh.	0
He's labeling - he's labeling right now.	0
I wasn't  asking  you.	0
He's?	0
Ah.	0
This is - this is  P_D_A   left.	0
Now.	0
You getting something there?	0
Yep.	0
And this is  P_D_A   right.	0
All  O_K.	0
They will	0
Thank you.	0
vary in future.	0
O_K.	0
Right.	0
Because it depends which one of these	0
Did  we  just  record  all that? Should we  start  it  over?	0
shows more  consistency  then.	0
No.	0
O_K.	0
Well, we're w- we're  so  ahead of the game now, cuz we've got	1
built-in  downsampling  now.	1
We have what? What do we have?	0
We've got  built-in  downsampling.	1
And so it's only recording  sixteen kilohertz data, and we've got -	1
Wait  a second.	0
We're not select- We're not recording the empty channels.	1
The ones that  aren't  filled out are the  ones  you want to  hand  out.	1
What about the ones that we  didn't   record?	1
No, I was looking for the ones -	0
I  threw  the  ones    out,  that we already	0
recorded but we didn't  record.	0
Oh.	0
O_K.	0
O_K?	0
Well, then, fine.	0
Fine.	0
Then it doesn't  matter,   does  it.	0
See if we care.	0
Well done.	0
Well done.	0
O_K.	0
You're probably wondering why I	0
brought you all here today.	0
Right.	0
But before w-	0
before we -	0
Before  that.	0
Right.	0
So the first task is to read some digits.	0
Before  that.	0
Yeah.	0
So I'll go ahead and start.	0
And	0
This is  Adam  on	0
mike number  two,	0
So. If you could just fill out the form,  and then	0
later on we'll read it,	0
with pauses between.	0
Good.	0
And we're session  two.	0
Shall I -	0
Do you wanna read next, or d- ?	0
n-	0
I'd like to hear one -	0
Let her fill it out and go ahead and read.	0
Yeah, I'd like to hear one more.	0
uh	0
O_K.	0
Um, this is Eric on	0
mike  one,	0
the wireless  lapel,  channel  zero.	0
um,	0
Could I hear you next?	0
O_K.	0
So, this is Dan	0
on mike three,	0
wireless headset, I'm wearing it around my  neck.	0
which may be different than wearing it on the head.	0
O_K.	0
So,  basically  they're kind of like  sentences  but with n-	0
numbers  instead of  words.  O_K.	0
So, I'm - I'm on uh number  four	0
with the  microphone   around my neck	0
and I will	0
read  these.	0
So you wanna  pause   briefly between each one	0
so that the person transcribing can tell  where one ends and one begins.	0
O_K.	0
So, a short sentence between each line.	0
And -	0
It  really  sounds like  sentences.	0
Your intonation sounds like -	0
Well,  you can  intone  it however you  want.  Imagine that you're	0
somewhat  like  sentence   intonation.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah?	0
reading a number -  phone  number to someone.	0
Yep.	0
Um,	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
Good.  Thanks.	0
Great.	0
So we'll probably do another one at the end  of the meeting.	0
Right.	0
just to get some more digits.	0
O_K.	0
And, uh	0
O_K.	0
Thank you.	0
If I were to be dictating a  phone  number, I would have done that	0
more  slowly,  but	0
uh -	0
which would have been	0
easier  for the -	0
of course,	0
for the  machine.	0
But.	0
Sure.	0
Was that an O_K pace?	0
It's kind of  weird.	0
Yeah. It's fine.	0
That was  great,  what you  did.	0
Um	0
O_K.	0
Just as long as it's with -	0
you know,	0
What- what's your  mike  number,  Jane?	0
uh  within the constraints.	0
Number four.	0
Oh,	0
Sorry.	0
Dan  doesn't remember what  sex  he is.	0
Yeah, cuz I  figure  no one's going to be able to  figure  it  out	0
from the - from my  name.  So,	0
That's true, it's - it's really difficult.	0
Yeah.	0
and the voice. Just no way.	0
Well, don't you - I - I wrote a  scanner  program that  scans  these  forms  in.	0
Oh, right, right, right.	0
@@	0
Anyway.  So,  why  did I  call  you all here?	0
Yes.	0
Um, what I'd  like  to talk about is, um	1
Oh,  you  did.	0
the transcription.	1
So, as  part  of this um  project,  we need to  transcribe  these  meetings.	1
um, to do  training  and  test  and so on.	1
and, uh, so we need	1
word  transcripts	1
and,	0
uh, speaker  change  identification.	1
So,  speaker  I_D.	1
And, uh	1
so I'd sort of like to know   who's  going to do that,	1
hi Jane,	0
and uh	1
what  tools to use,  what other resources you might  need,	1
and  also  what we -	0
things like just the data format	1
and	0
how  we're going to  do  it.	1
So, I'm just curious how - how - h-	0
how exactly you got roped  into  this.	0
I mean -	0
Oh.	0
Um, because my name was -	0
was mentioned when I wasn't around, but I'm most happy.	0
O_K. Good.	0
Oh really? Cuz Morgan said he  asked  you.	0
Oh, uh he  did.	0
and - and I  approved.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
but I think that I was	0
uh	0
proposed before I was asked?	0
And that doesn't matter	0
cuz I think there was probably an a-	0
Oh.	0
uh	0
Yeah. That would be m-	0
y- an indication that -	0
That would be  my  fault.	0
that I was interested in advance	0
and, in which case, I  thank  you.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
Uh	0
right.	0
And so, one of the  first  questions is,	0
O_K.	0
"do you need  help? "	0
Well,  hang  on.	0
Oh?	0
That's  not  the first question.	0
Well,	0
O_K.	0
Well, I  guess.	0
Do you - So, do you -	0
What are - what are we  talking  about? That you're gonna -	0
you're gonna do  transcriptions?  You're going to listen to these things and -	0
I'm going to provide -	0
I'm going to be -	1
once I'm given the	1
data, I will provide	1
w- word-level  transcripts	1
O_K.	0
with	1
uh indication of speakers,	1
and	1
um	1
I guess speaker  change  in any case, so	1
speaker I_D,	1
and words.	0
O_K.	0
So you're gonna	0
do the actual transcription yourself.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
D- I- And do you have a clear - I mean, is that -	0
Do you sort of -	0
Are you going to have to make  up  what you do or do you have a very	1
clear   idea  of what you're going to  do?	1
So I mean, is it - is it -	0
Well	0
Is this l-	0
Is it  like something you've done before? or -	0
I've transcribed a  lot.	1
Yeah.	0
But um e-	0
you know,	0
the -	0
I mean, there are always ways of doing things	0
And,	0
more  efficiently  or	0
more	0
uh -	0
in a more technical- technically sophisticated way?	0
Yeah.	0
Do you have to speak	0
true English sentences when you do this?	0
Yeah, because as- people are going to be listening to it afterwards and saying	0
"Oh listen to  her.  She couldn't even speak true English  sentences! "	0
"She can't speak!"	0
"It's terrible!"	0
O_K,	0
So	0
Oh, you're meant - You're meant to speak naturally. You're meant to say	0
um	0
" Oh,  I didn't  realize  we were being recorded!"	0
Ah  right.	0
Yeah.	0
"No one told me that."	0
"This  microphone,  what's  this  doing around my neck?"	0
Uh, that's -  I - I was saying before we don't really have to  worry  about people being  surprised  by it.	0
It's just -	0
It's just  jewelry.	0
O_K, so um	0
typically, what I w- you know I - in -	0
uh	0
i-	0
what I've done  before  is I have a -	0
uh	0
tape recorder, with a reverse button.	0
Yeah.	0
And you just,	0
you know, if it's  word  level	0
e- you know, you do a -	0
e-	0
a r-	0
I just hit the r-	0
re-	0
Play.	0
the rewind button	0
every couple of words and	0
type  what I know and then -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
and then	0
at the end do a	0
breeze through to be sure that everything's correct. However, they do have software these days which -	0
with a digitized	0
uh record	0
you can have control over replay	0
through some sort of an interface.	0
Yeah.	0
Um.	0
I've  never  used one of those. I  know  it would be an -  a    wonderful  idea.	0
It's just	0
I haven't transcribed in -	0
in  awhile.	0
The  problem  is -	0
I mean -	0
Right.	0
The  nice  thing about  transcribers  is they have  foot  pedals,	0
Foot pedals? I've used transcribing machines.	0
That's fine.	0
um	0
But I frankly	0
didn't find it any more use to me than	0
Oh.	0
my  hand-held taperecorder.	0
I  see.	0
However, if we  have  a transcribing machine	1
I would  accept  it.	1
The other thing is,	1
you know,	0
having -	0
getting  hold  of a transcriber. I think that CogSci has one.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
And I could probably borrow one.	0
Well,	0
I - I - I actually  have  one.	1
one th-	0
You  have one  yourself?	0
Well,  Sarah  has one because she does a lot of	1
Oh, I see!	0
transcribing  of  interviews.	1
Oh, super!	0
But	1
The  other  thing is is that we might be -	0
The  crazy  thing is we'd have to	1
Oh.	0
convert  the s-	1
we'd have to  dump  the audio files onto  cassette.	1
to use it.	1
Oh,  I  see.	0
O_K.	0
I mean, given that we've already	1
got them  digitally	0
it would be -	1
you know, it's quite  tempting  to use some kind of uh  software  thing.	1
Oh, O_K.	0
But - but then there's the  question  of the ergonomic  interface,  that -	0
I kn-	0
Oh,	1
I  actually   have  some  foot  pedals for the P_ C.	1
Well, that's what I was gonna  say,  is	0
that Adam has  foot  pedals that we could  probably  try and  rig  something up to -	0
O_K.	0
Oh, that'd be  super.	0
What do they  connect  to?	1
Uh, keyboard.	1
and they generate  keystrokes.	1
Oh, that's  totally   cool.	1
now how - how do you -	1
how do you decide which  keystrokes  they generate?	1
Um	1
There's a little  program  that downloads  into  it.	1
Hmm.	0
This  is great.	0
Um.	0
And this is  Windows?	0
But the  program   probably  only runs in Windows, although I bet we could	1
program it  once	1
Uh-huh.	1
And -	0
and then put it on  another   machine  and it would  work.	0
Except for the fact that we would have to unplug it and pow- and	0
I  haven't   used  them.	0
change - it w-	0
Does it lose the memory	0
once you've unpowered it?	0
I don't know.	0
I don't  think  it does.	0
So  hang  on. You have -	0
You  have  these foot pedals but you d- you're not  using  them.	0
I'm not  using  them anymore. I  used  to use them.	0
So they're  currently  set up	0
for  Shift,   Control,  and  Alt.	0
Yeah.	0
But I r- I don't  use  them.  They're not even plugged  in.	0
Wow.	0
That's so  cool.	0
O_K.	0
This sounds  wonderful.	0
And so tha- uh if that would  help,  uh I'm  certainly  willing to  donate  them.	0
Well,	0
I'm - I'm open to -	0
the d- the - well, the uh	1
The part that's  not  wonderful is someone has to  write  the  software.	1
Right.	0
Yeah, that's  true.	0
And it - it  is  a P_C connection, so it would have to go on a P_ C  somewhere.	0
Well,	0
you know -	0
Yeah.	0
Now, we're at a  pilot  phase right now, and  what I was told is that	0
Mm-hmm.	0
beginning,	0
you know,	0
that the - the pilot data would be something like half hour of uh - or f-	0
you know -	0
half hour to forty minutes of running text.	0
And so,  for the  pilot  thing,	0
you know, of  course  this would be  useful.	0
Right, this  is  the pilot data.	0
And I w- I wou- I'm assu-	0
I'm  assuming  that I would not be	0
Yeah,  yeah,  you are   generating  it.	0
uh	0
you know	0
e- eh uh	0
transcribing  all  of it.	0
So,	0
Well, that - that was part of the  question,  is that if,	0
for -	0
Right.	0
if we're doing this  regularly  - Imagine we're doing a couple of hours a week of  transcripts	1
Yeah.	0
um, of  recording,	0
uh, I  wouldn't  expect you to do it  all.	1
No.	0
No, no.	0
So the question is do you know of  resources  that we could  use.	1
So are there  grad  students or  undergrads  or just	1
Yes.	0
Mm-hmm, yeah, O_K, so now I've -	0
commercial services?	1
I've been involved with some of that.	0
At - at CogSci,	0
um -	0
So,  Susan   E-	0
Susan Ervin-Tripp,	0
who you know	0
um would typically, and I've done this too, supervise undergrads	0
Hmm.	0
to	0
do this kind of thing	0
and they c-	0
you know,	0
you can give  them   like -	0
if you give  them   a little bit of instruction and -	1
and make it  interesting  for  them	1
they can do it as a two ninety-eight or s-	1
or,  not  two ninety-eight, what is it, one- whatever,	1
undergraduate research credit.	1
Because what you do is, you can -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Oh, really?	0
So we  only  have to give them  credits,	1
you know, build it into some sort of a -	0
We  don't  have to give them  money?	1
Well uh, you have to be sure you give them compensation for - you know.	1
Oh, you  do  have to pay them.	0
of some - of  some  sort. What I mean is it's not necessarily  monetary.	1
Awesome .	0
But if they feel like they're getting something  out  of it,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
sometimes you can do it  that  way.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And otherwise, as part of a grant,	0
you can -	0
you can do it.	0
some sort of	0
minimal	0
Yeah.	0
wage.	0
Well, we - we need to -	1
We  need to find out how much that will cost, so I can  pass  that on to Morgan,	1
Yeah.	0
cuz right now we have almost no money.	1
Yeah, O_K.	0
So - so the  cheaper  we can do it, the  better.	1
Well, -	0
O_K.	0
Well, you  also  want to get  quality.	1
I mean,  someone's  going to have to pass through -	1
Yeah, absolutely.	0
Either a  higher  level person will have to pass through, or you have to be sure you get	1
Mm-hmm.	0
good quality	0
Right.	0
to  begin  with.	1
But um,	0
yeah, that's quite -	0
you know - we've -	0
That's been	0
done.	0
I can ask Susan Ervin-Tripp	1
Yeah.	0
what she would recommend on that. She's really -	1
She's done -	0
Of the people that I know, she's the one who's supervised the most of those things locally.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
What's her name?	1
Uh	0
uh Doctor Susan Ervin-Tripp.	0
O_K.	0
faculty member in Psychology, recently retired,	0
Uh-huh.	0
So -	0
and very well known in discourse analysis.	0
Oh,  O_K . So, the p-	0
I mean, what I'm	0
hearing  is that	0
the	0
problem  of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts	0
is kind of -	0
I mean, it's not a - it's not an unfamiliar problem.	0
So that -	0
Oh, it's  very  common.	0
So that I mean that basically,	1
Yeah.	1
there are  standard  solutions and we should just adopt -	1
adopt  them and it's going to  cost  however much it's going to  cost,	1
I mean there's -	0
We're - we're  probably   not  going to have a lot of  flexibility  in	0
bringing  down  the cost cuz probably	1
the low cost solution's already been  established.	1
And so that's just whatever it is.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
That's	0
how we'll do it.	0
See what I mean?	0
I think there's  always  this question of the  trade-off  between uh	0
paying  more for the first pass,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and then h-	0
and then  editing  less  later.	0
Uh-huh.	0
or	0
paying  less  the first pass and editing  more  later. So	0
Yeah.	0
Well,	0
whatever they -	0
people who have had to do this -	1
I mean the only thing is	1
I wonder if  our  requirements are  different  from um -	1
I mean there's - than -	1
than what's been done in the past	1
than discourse analyzers	1
because	1
maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align-	1
you know, how much  time   aligned detail we need	1
and uh how much detail in terms of people.	1
Oh,	0
But that's a s-	0
Mm-hmm. O_K.	0
I don- I don't know how much ti- I don't think we  do  need any time aligned detail.	0
I think we just have	0
basically one text file which runs from beginning to end.	0
But.	0
Well, if - in terms of  transcripts,  sure, but in terms of  speaker  change it might be	0
nice to get the actual	0
time.	0
Sure.	0
But not if it  costs  more.	0
Right.	0
Well, O_K. So what  happened  with  Switchboard	0
was	0
at least,	0
I mean, the  output	0
was that they had	0
speaker  turns	0
and they	0
um	0
analyzed it in terms of,	0
you know, " this  is where this speaker change came in"	0
and of course that gets really	0
difficult when you're talking about - I mean, this is some of the stuff that you were	0
Mm-hmm.	0
talking about in	0
uh	0
your lunch talk, is that - is that	0
Right.	0
you know, you get backchannels and stuff like that, that	0
that,	0
you know, disrupt the	0
um	0
the	0
Yeah.	0
segment- you know the	0
segmentation.	0
Right,  I mean,	0
the - it's sort of it's - a little -	0
In some sense it's a little bit easier with it - with	0
Switchboard  because the telephone is so -	0
actually people	0
are less flexible in what they do. In this kind of situation where	0
we've got	0
nonverbal	0
channels	0
then  there's a lot of overlap	0
and there's just that it's not a very good model.	0
Right.	0
Oh,	1
in terms of  data  format, what are we going to  do  about that?	1
I mean,	0
you have the  S_T_  M  format, where you have	0
you know, every  phrase,  every  utterance  is - is	0
a single speaker.	0
I mean, is  that  the  right  way to  do  it? Or -	0
Well,	0
every utterance is a single  speaker,  right?	0
It's just that utterances can  overlap.	0
I mean,	0
Is that the right way to do it?	0
I  think so.	0
I think - I think - I mean, I think when I'm - when -	0
O_K.	0
Like, So,  Eric  made a s- made a sentence,	0
and that should be like one	0
utterance	0
and then  I  had a couple of backchannels  in  there	0
and they should be just overlapping  things  that -	0
I don't think that we should  break  Eric's sentences for  those.  I think -	0
O_K. So that means that for each  utterance,  we'll need the time marks,	1
Right.	0
the start and end of each  utterance.	1
Yeah.	0
So.	0
So -	0
Well, we'll have to  go  in from  somewhere	0
but we can't necessarily -	0
I mean, we - we  may  be able to get the  transcriber  to give them to us	0
if we	0
give them  software	0
but	0
we may  not	0
in which case we'll have to get them	0
some  other  way, like with forced alignment  later,  I mean	0
you know all this  can  be  done.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So we - maybe we should look at the um -	0
the tools that Mississippi State has.	0
Yeah.	0
Because, I d- I - I know that they published	0
um	0
i-	0
annotation tools,	0
Well,  X_Waves  have some as  well,  but they're  pretty  low  level.	0
you know, for their ins-	0
They're designed for um -	0
Yeah.	0
Phoneme - phoneme - phoneme transcriptions. Yeah.	0
for  phoneme-level	0
I should've -	0
Although, they  actually  have a  nice  tool for -	0
that could be used for  speaker  change  marking.	0
There's a - there are - there's a  whole   bunch  of tools. There's a - some web	0
Yes.	0
page, where they have a list of like ten of them or something.	0
Are you speaking about Mississippi State per se? or are y-	0
O_K.	0
No, no, no. There's  some  -	0
I mean, I just - there are - there are a lot of	0
Yeah.	0
a lot of  @@  these things.	0
Actually, I wanted to mention -	0
There are  two  projects, which	0
are	0
international,	0
huge  projects  focused  on this kind of thing,	0
actually.	0
One of them's  MATE,	0
one of them's  EAGLES.	0
and um.	0
Oh,  EAGLES.	0
Yeah, that's the  European  one.	0
And  both  of them have -	0
Yeah.	0
You know, I saw- I know you know about the big book.	0
Yeah.	0
I think you got it as a  prize  or something.	0
Mmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Got a surprise.	0
And um	0
and they have	0
you know, a  lot  of -	0
and	0
MATE is a project which is	0
being run out of  Denmark	0
and	0
um	0
they have a lot uh -	0
big	0
uh,	0
e- you know,	0
they're trying to set up a -	0
a  work  bench or something or other. And they have a whole bunch of tools that are associated with them.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So, I mean, there  are  things that	0
in terms of like the  time  alignment issue	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I mean,   you  guys are more expert on  that,	0
I mean ,	0
than I am,	0
but I want to say that	0
I know for a  fact,  I keep running  across  these,	0
and  those  would be  my  first two choices of looking at.	0
EAGLES and MATE.	0
And I  have  the documentation downstairs.	0
I didn't think to bring it.	0
O_K.	0
Ha- Have you  looked  at it  already?	0
Oh, I have, but I wasn't interested in that particular issue.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
a- a- is this -	0
So, we're talking now,	0
once you have words	0
you know, how do you  time  align it.	0
and that's.	0
Oh. So, these are p-  particularly  for time alignment?	0
Well, these are uh tools -	0
So, MATE and EAGLES are both within the so-called	0
uh Language Engineering branch,	0
and um	0
so they're  intended  for this kind of a	0
Yeah.	0
comp- compu- s- computer science  application  type of approach. These are not discourse types of tools.	0
Right.	0
So.	0
They -	0
Right.  - are they just for time alignment or are they for	0
Can I be excused,	0
transcription as well?	0
and I'll go down and get my stuff?	0
because um I - I do think -	0
You don't -  Just take the thing with you.	0
Th- i-	0
Are  you  serious?	0
It's  wireless.  I mean it won't -	0
Well,	0
I don't know what will  happen,  but  you may as  well.	0
I - but - but - what uh - I mean,	0
can you spare like a minute or two of a -	0
Sure. Sure. Sure.	0
Sure.	0
Sure.	0
O_K. And I go get my books and I'll be right back.	0
I didn't think of bringing this.	0
Do I need this? I need my keys.	0
O_K.	0
Oops!  I need my card key.	0
My uh-	0
We can hear all your conversations along the way.	0
My s-	0
Yeah, so be just -	0
I'll try not to say, "So, Oh dear,	0
Yeah, don't  talk  to yourself too much.	0
Yeah.	0
Boy! That's itching there!" So,	0
Yeah,  that's  true.	0
You  can  leave it behind as well if you  want.	0
So,	0
I-	0
For the  digits  -	0
For the d-	0
I assume that these are projects where they do the whole thing, right?	0
Right.	0
So they probably  will  have tools to address the actual	0
Oops.	0
the - the - the  transcriber  support  and   then  automated alignment of what the transcribers give you, which is, you know,  exactly  the problem we have. So.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right, but  we  can do automated alignment.  That's  not a problem	0
O_K	0
Right.	0
I think	0
Right.	0
But then again we don't  have  to do it.	0
and -	1
Well, I'm not  sure  if we can do automated alignment or  not.	1
I mean,	0
e- especially in e- with  speaker  change in a meeting like this, where we're  overlapping  so much, I don't think we're gonna have a -	0
I th-	0
a  prayer.	0
Oh  sure,  we are. We've got individual  microphones.	0
Well, to get -	0
to get the r- to get the actual transcript, I think	0
we'll do O_K because of -	0
because of the separate channels.	0
Oh,  that's  true. Right. We could just do it through  these.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
I hadn't even  thought  about that.  Sure.	0
Um.	0
In terms of  data  formats, uh	0
what I  did  for the  Digits  stuff was just	0
to  hand-rolled  my  own.	0
That  looks like this  form.	0
You know, it's  just  uh  something  that's  easy  to  parse  in  Perl.	0
Um.	0
Probably  for	0
the  full  one, we'll want to do  something   like  S_T_ M.	0
I mean, some format that our tools already  work  with.	0
Yeah.	0
Well,	0
Yes,	0
although that might  @@	0
presumably we'll have one -	0
we'll have  several  formats that you can interconvert between.	0
When we want to do recognition we'll do S_T_M, but	1
Right.	0
Yeah, presumably.	0
if we're -	1
rather than - rather than designing our own format,	1
we'll just take whatever	1
comes out of the tools that we can find to use, I think.	1
Yeah, I guess that's true.	0
Yeah.	0
I - I - I've got  no   idea	0
Right.	0
what  that'll  look  like.	0
but	0
Well I  know  that -	0
on our speaker phones.	0
I know that  um	0
the Mississippi State tools, at least th- what the produce	0
does  not  come out in S_T_M format.	0
Right.	0
They - they basically give	0
um	0
They subdivide into WAVE files	0
and then they give -	0
for each, they give a one -	0
oh, you know,	0
a WAVE file that g- indicates where the start and stop times are,	0
Mmm-hmm.	0
and then -	0
um	0
and then give the	0
uh	0
whatever -	0
the	0
sentence  information.	0
Yeah.	0
But	0
I mean	0
Ni- i-	0
i- i- it -	0
as you said, it was easy to convert	0
back and forth between	0
um	0
that file and S_T_M format,	0
in fact what I did is I took the Mississippi State data,	0
and just made S_T_M files out of it.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
Good.	0
O_K. "MATE  Mark-up  Framework".  O_K?	0
Right.	0
" Specification   of uh Coding workbench",	0
Mm-hmm.	0
That's one o- thing, and then, back in here	0
Oh,  no!  It has the word "X_M_ L " in it!	0
Oh, good.	0
It must be - It must be  fundable  then.	0
"K_C_M file formats",	0
Oh, looks like -	0
This is the	0
Looks like uh  work  packages.	0
Must be  a European  project.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, yeah.	0
Yeah, it is European. Both of these are Eur- European,	0
@@	0
but they have	0
you know, American contributions, and stuff.	0
Oh, so  they're  using the Alembic	0
Workbench,  from Mitre.	0
Alembic?	0
I  guess.	0
Yeah.	0
Is that free?	0
I don't know.	0
Well i- but you see they have a whole bunch of things.	0
What they're doing is trying to bring together -	0
and they rate things. I wasn't focused on that so I didn't -	0
Let me show y-	0
Have you seen this one, Dan?	0
No.	0
And I'll try to get one for you, too.	0
Oh, you've  got  one.	0
What are you looking at here?	0
He's got the  Mark-up  Framework.	0
Oh, yeah.	0
Different coding schemes.	0
But it doesn't have enough  pictures.	0
O_K.	0
So, I think	0
it will require too much  reading  to understand whether this is anything	0
Oh,	0
this is,	0
I see.	0
They're reviewing, and -	0
that we can easily use.	0
What they're doing is they're comp- comparing all these existing things that have been submitted and	0
I see.	0
And it includes, this one includes the T_E_I and	0
uh	0
so it's - it's um	0
pretty broad-based.	0
These things  do  seem to be -	0
"T_E_I" is - ?	0
Mitre,	0
That's the Text Encoding Initiative.	0
Oh.	0
That's a way of marking- mark-up.	0
so, you know, but  focus  on   tools  to  do  this stuff	0
um, I do have a file also in addition to those things, but	0
it'll take me just a second here	0
Well, I  guess  X_M_L	1
makes  some  amount of  sense.   I'm  not actually  familiar  with it but	1
it seems to be the sort of thing	0
that this would be  good  for.	0
But -	0
Well, yeah, I mean, if you  start  with a -	0
a basic transcription	0
and a good  filter.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
You can -	0
I mean, that's	0
sort of  my  feeling about it, that you should be -	0
you should be able to   translate   between	0
an X_M_L and non-X_M_L version cuz most -	0
Right.	0
at  least,  you know, with a focus on  discourse,   mostly.	0
Oh! I wanted to m-	0
This -  this  approach  here  - This is Uli Heid from  Stuttgart  -	0
is um a query language for research in phonetics where he	0
wants to build in ToBI tags and - so you can	0
determine	0
um - I wanted to mention  this  to  you.   I was	0
Mm-hmm.	0
going to come by and ask you about this.	0
Do you know about the Stuttgart um people?	0
Because  he's  saying if you  represent  -	0
I  don't   think  so.	0
He says that uh in German	0
"selbst" is used in two different ways so you have	0
It either means uh "himself" or it means " even "	0
and you can tell the difference in terms of uh  intonation.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So,	0
Hmm.	0
they have the recordings such that they	0
can  locate  things  uh	0
with - by searching	0
for	0
Mm-hmm.	0
part of speech and also	0
intonational   tags.	0
Anyway,   that's   that.	0
Because the transcriber's put in intonational tags?	0
This is true.	0
This is true.	0
Which of course is another issue.	0
Or maybe not.	0
Exactly so.	0
and then -	0
I have  one  more thing I need to find.	0
Well.	0
But  that  kind of thing	0
And then I'll be -	0
I think we would probably want to  extract   automatically.	0
I mean,	0
e- this is,	0
Yeah.	0
the - this is a conversation that we should have with Liz.	0
Yes.	0
Oh.  O_K.	0
Right,	0
I think, because she's going to be -	0
She's  going to be the one who's the most	0
concerned about	0
this kind of thing.	0
O_K.	0
And  so    she  may have some ideas.	0
on - on that particular issue.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right, but it's - I think for the  initial  task,	1
Yeah. I w- I -	0
just getting the word transcripts and  speaker  change	1
Yeah.	0
is  highest  on  my  list.	1
Well that's what Morgan mentioned to me, too. I mean, if - in terms of	0
So.	0
Yeah.	0
the t- the  type   -	1
But you asked me about uh	1
tools  and things and um	1
Yeah.	0
There's  this  one	0
um	0
This is called " Transcriber ".	0
um	0
"binary distribution for -  for	0
uh	0
Linux and Solaris and	0
S_G_I and  Windows ".	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
"Transcriber is a tool for assisting creation of  speech  corpora."	1
Who's it from?	0
Right.	0
"It allows	1
to manually segment, label and transcribe  speech  signals"	1
Is it the French one?	0
And,	0
uh, let's see, where did I get this? I got this from U_Penn.	1
U_Penn.	0
I  think  that I've  heard  of this one. It was the one that Steve  Renals	0
But -	0
mentioned.	0
It  is  possible.	0
It could be French. I can't really tell.	0
Well I  think  that uh -	0
Can I see that?	0
It  sounds  like you're at least a  little  familiar with these  tools,  Jane, so	0
Are y- Do you feel comfortable just  picking  one?	0
Um, because -	0
I've never used  any  of them.	0
O_K.	0
And so um I think it would be something that we should work	0
uh  together  with, in terms of	0
Sure.	0
uh	0
seeing how this -	0
Right.	0
Here's  another  thing I got.	0
Oh, so this'd - this w- is	0
probably  what the L_D_ C  uses. I mean they do a lot of  transcription  at the L_D_ C.	0
O_K.	0
I  could ask my  contacts  at the L_D_C what -	0
what it  is  they actually  use.	0
Oh!  Good  idea.	0
I mean, I know,	0
I mean	0
Great  idea.	0
I've got -	0
I've got contacts up there, so.	0
Signed language is interesting.	0
Excellent  idea.	0
So.	0
"Automatic annotation of prosody in  Verbmobil. "	0
Can I see?	0
Yeah.	0
This is the  other  think that  um - This is part of EAGLES, but	0
um,	0
but here again, it's focusing on representation rather than the tools to do this.	0
Why  do I feel like I'm  whispering?	0
Well, so,  how  should we  proceed  on  picking  a  tool?	1
Jane, do you want to   pick  a  few  and we'll  download  them and	1
try  them  out?	0
Is that the right thing to do?	1
Oh!	0
I think that would be  lovely.	1
Now, so, are we talking about	1
the stage of -	0
uh  simply  the  word	1
stage?	1
or are you talking about tools that would allow the time alignment	1
as well?	1
No, we're not going to do time alignment.	0
No.	0
Well -	1
O_K.	0
Well,	0
We  are  going to do time alignment.	1
but we'll probably do it  ourselves,  right?	1
So we're not - we're not  concerned  about getting - getting -	1
Right.	0
about buying and - or	1
We're very good at time alignments.	0
bringing  in  tools.	1
O_K.	0
We're  not  very good but we're	0
proud  of ourselves.	0
Right. O_K.	0
We're very  proud  of our time alignment.	0
Absolutely.	0
Yeah,	0
O_K.	0
Right, and so -	1
Good.	0
but, in terms of what the  transcriber  needs to do,	1
they're not going to have to do time alignment.	1
Oh  good,   O_K .	0
Except	0
Fine.	0
maybe for word-  speaker  change, but -	0
Right. I mean, it's not a bad - Oh look!	0
It uses Snack!	0
Um.	0
Uses what?	0
It uses Snack.	1
That's a  T_C_L  audio  thing that I  had some involvement with.	1
O_K , then we'll have to use it.	0
Oh, cool.	0
Very cool.	0
No - no question.	0
Yeah.	0
If I have to use it I'm  sure  - I'm  sure  -	0
It's a T_C_L-based thing. I'm sure it's just  wonderful.	0
Cool.	0
Cool. Yeah.	0
Yes, T-	1
"Transcriber was developed with the scripting language T_C_L T_K and C_ extensions.  It relies on the Snack sound extension, which allows support for most common audio formats."	1
Cool.	0
Boy, the  recognition  on what you just  mumbled  is going to be  really  horrible.	0
Yeah.  It's the  French  one.	0
Oh,  cool!	0
Yeah.	0
O_K .	0
There.	0
There you go.	0
I mean, no, I - I -	0
I- I love it when they c-	0
But I've never  downloaded  it. Someone mentioned it to me.	0
And that's probably  why  they mentioned it to me,	0
because they thought I would be  excited	0
because it's T_C_L-based.	0
Did you see this one?	0
The- ,	0
Did you see this one here?	0
Oh "Deliverable D_three point one", Oh yeah.	0
O_K, So, so, it's called " Transcriber " you said?	0
O_K.	0
gacks	0
Transcriber	0
Whoa!	0
So it's very interest- I mean,	0
it's interesting that	0
one of the coordinators on that is Mark Liberman	0
@@	0
from the L_D_C	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Which means that -	0
I don't know what	0
"coordinator" means	0
in - in terms of that.	0
I mean	0
Well, I think -	0
What -	0
what is - what is - what is this web page from?	0
Well, I apparently, -	0
you know, I roam around	0
on - on topics like this	0
Sure.	0
And I think I got this off the U_ Penn	0
and it does in fact cite a French site, so um	0
they have  some  sort of an arrangement.	0
I see.	0
Well, I  just  wrote down	1
the  French  site and I will check it and try to  download  it	1
Right.	0
And uh see what it  looks  like.	0
Good.	0
You- you  can  access it through um -	0
through the, uh,	0
whatever -	0
I can't remember which	0
aspect of U- of U_Penn I was	0
Right.	0
following, but	0
It  must  have been the L_D_C.	0
I - I - I bet you anything.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, they have a -	0
I vaguely recall that they have a  pages-  uh  tools  page	0
Mm-hmm. O_K.	0
somewhere,	0
with like	0
O_K.	0
lists and lists and lists of uh	0
Yes.	0
various and assorted tools.	0
Well there's -	0
They have a special project, as I'm remembering,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and um, usually it doesn't deal with much that has to do with discourse,	0
but they uh -	0
they show up in	0
resources.	0
So,	1
Um,	0
we'll start with " Transcriber " and if it looks like that's  not  gonna	1
do  what we need,	1
we'll  move on to the Mississippi State and if it doesn't look like  that's  going to work,	1
we'll look at  something    else.	1
I like that very much, and I- and I like the idea of also doing one that's tied in with	0
O_K.	0
these larger corp-  corpus projects. So that, you know, the fact that,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mmm.	0
Yeah.	0
yeah, it's U_Penn and all that.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Also, I  wanted  to mention just in  passing  that	1
uh  another  thing that we're going to want to start  collecting  is  queries  for the  meetings.	1
So if  over  the  next  couple of days you find yourself wondering what we  talked  about in the  meeting,	0
write   down  the sort of  query  you'd like to  make.	0
Oh,  good   idea.	0
Do you  understand  what I  mean?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
It's like the P_D_A thing.	0
So,	0
imagine  that we  had   Meeting  Recorder all  done,	0
and you  had  one,	0
what  might you do	0
with  it?	0
So,	0
if they  occur  to you.	0
So, like	0
"did the French system use Tcl?"	0
Right.	0
That's a  good  one.	0
Actually what I would have	0
Send m-	0
come up with was	0
So, if you could just  email  me them.	0
w- w-	0
"What was the web address of that  thing",	0
which we didn't -	0
Yeah, except we didn't  record.	0
we didn't record that.	0
So.	0
Right.	0
It's W_W_W dot E_T_C_A dot F_R.	0
That's a fine question.	0
if anyone wants to know.	0
Wow.	0
But you could get it through the U_Penn -	0
slash - slash  capital C_T_A  slash, l-  Yeah.	0
s- l-	0
slash lots of other stuff, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
So this thing, this uh deliverable D_three point one of the MATE	1
Right.	0
project is	1
a review of a lot of different tools.	1
Yes!	0
Yeah, there you go.	0
They're actually, they seem to be more	0
Exactly.	0
the tool- the main focus of the tools is	1
you've already got a transcription but you're trying to tag the different turns	1
transi- transcriptions with uh	1
discourse roles	1
I see.	1
and things like that.	0
But I mean a lot them are tools that will also do transcription as well.	0
And I could be wrong.	0
Well, my-  my  impression- I - I -	0
I really thought of these resources in the context of you -	0
you asking about	0
time aligning the - you know, What would you need to indicate	0
Right.	0
and were there tools for that because	0
um	0
I suspect that  would  be	0
uh pretty	0
time intensive.	0
I also wanted to say, in terms of like	0
disc-	0
you know, if there are discussions about intonation contours	0
I  do  have	0
a certain amount of  background  in that and I really would be -	0
Right.	0
I'd like to be  involved  in that.	0
No, right, I didn't mean to imply that	0
Yeah.	0
that we -	0
that - that we shouldn't discuss this  now,  but I'm -	0
I'm just saying that -	0
Oh, not right now, but I mean in the  future.  So at this meeting with Liz	0
Right.	0
I - you know, I mean -	0
Right.	0
I - I  do  -	0
I'd like to -	0
I like that stuff.	0
Sure, sure.	0
So, when is she showing up?	0
Well,	0
I mean, they're coming in April.	0
April. O_K.	0
Right.	0
But,	0
um	0
You know, we - we may or may not	0
talk before then	0
Mm-hmm.	0
on that.	0
Um.	1
I - I think we won't	1
probably talk until we have more data, I would think.	1
Right?	0
Right, since we have	0
almost   none  right now,	0
let's	0
Yeah.	0
We need to move  forward  from  there.	0
But uh,  yeah,   I  guess it's O_ K.	0
And then, uh	1
there's  also  just the  general  question of  will it handle multiple  channels  or should we just -	1
Dan and I spoke about this  briefly,	1
do we want to try to  combine  channels somehow	1
to make the transcriber's job  easier?	1
I was  listening  to some of it and uh	1
like, if you  just   listen  to the  far	0
P_Z_ M	0
the person sitting at  this  end of the table you can hardly hear at  all.	0
on - on the transcript, so there may be -	1
it may be worthwhile to at least	1
try a  little  bit	1
to  combine  the channels.	1
Right.	0
I -	1
Uh, the stuff  I  did, I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs, listened to them in  stereo.	1
And I was very impressed by how	1
Huh. Neat!	0
well you could hear	1
separate speakers, but I haven't -	1
I haven't done very extensive tests.	1
Oh, so,  that  would be	0
interesting as  well  to do that.	0
Oh!	0
Yeah, cuz you'd get	0
you get -	0
you get a certain amount of spatial information.	1
Right!	0
It's not - It's not consistent but it's -	0
Well, I bet if you used	0
Wow.	0
Gives you some	0
this  one -	0
noise -	0
the  two  s- most  separated  P_Z_ Ms  -	0
Well,  maybe, maybe not.	0
Yeah, yeah, you'd get - get wide coverage.	0
Well, you would - you would - sound like you'd have like in this e- big	0
Big ears.	0
Right. Right.	0
But I mean - But you would -  you would - You know, you'd get	0
big head.	0
good -	0
You'd get good  pick  up at both ends of the  table.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
So.	0
Right.	0
O_K, do we have  anything  else to talk about with  transcribes?	1
Well, what is - what is the goal?	1
again?	0
We're going to end up with  some  -	0
I mean,  ultimately,  we're going to end up with	0
transcriptions  of these  meetings.	0
And we'll run a -	0
train a neural net	0
and	0
create a recognizer and	0
do	0
What, and then -	0
Then -	0
information retrieval and -	0
Then we'll be done, huh?	0
Well, that's  my  interest.	0
I mean,  other  people have different  interests,  so.	0
Um.	0
That's what  I  want.	0
Of course, there are different kinds of recos-	0
so we're going to actually train a recognizer based on these	0
uh, far-field mikes  cuz what we - that's the problem we're trying to solve.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
O_K.	0
We need a lot of - I mean -	0
Well, what - the -	0
so, the  reason  we're doing near field as  well  is if that doesn't  work  we wanna back-	0
we want some -	0
Well -	1
and also the near field will allow us to do the  time  alignment accurately.	1
something that will work.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
Um.	0
So these are near - near field?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
there	0
Yeah. Yeah.  Close mikes.	0
O_K.	0
I mean I - yeah, I feel like -	0
that - What we're actually going to  do  with these data is	0
very  unclear to me	0
Why?	0
Well, because I  don't  think that's a -	0
Y-	0
That's   not  going to work. Right? O_K. We're going to get  horrible   performance  on that.	0
The  question  is, "is it - will it work well enough to do  information  retrieval?"	1
Uh-huh.	0
So, w- will the application - the Meeting Recorder  application,	1
work?	1
Yeah.	0
So,	1
Is -	1
Part  of the  research  is um	1
"is fifty percent	1
accuracy  enough  to do an- useful  information  retrieval?"	1
Well, part-	0
It  might  be.	0
I-	0
Well, we  know  the answer to  that,	0
but unfortunately,  will  we get fifty percent p- accuracy?	0
That's right,	0
Well, but you know we have to  try.	0
Yeah.	0
We - we - we could  simply   not   do  the  project.	0
But I think that's a  bad   solution.	0
W-	0
We  also  need to d-	0
do this in terms of  SmartKom,	0
I mean, we're collecting this as -	0
to build general	0
English acoustic models.	0
that	0
can be	0
that they can say "O_K here's the vocabulary and	0
here's the -	0
you know, here are the pronunciations.	0
And go to it."	0
And are they specifically far field	0
Yeah.	0
mikes?	0
Yeah.	0
Oh,  I didn't  know  that.	0
O_K.	0
You know, if - if we were to add  in  addition,	1
and I'm  offering  this,	1
um	0
to the  word  level,	1
also	1
the -	1
uh, so,  stressed  words,	1
within	0
utterances	1
Yeah.	0
I  do  think that that would help the information retrieval.	1
Well, I mean, that would be tremendously useful information	0
O_K.	0
assuming that we actually	1
pursue  it,	1
but	0
um	0
we've got a  huge  problem, because if we ge- if we want train a recognizer we need  tens  of  hours  of labeled data.	0
Oh, good point.	0
And um	0
it's just eh - it's very frightening.	0
Yep.	0
Do you think -	0
So, are - are you familiar with this	0
the MARS- the MARSEC project?	0
uh-uh	0
Um,	0
So,	0
I'll put this over here, cuz he seems to be the chairman.	0
Um.	0
Who?	0
Who, Eric?	0
Oh, he's  not?	0
No.	0
He has - he has the open piece of paper.	0
Well	0
Uh-huh.	0
So,	0
open notebook.	0
He - Yeah.	0
Well, he can -	0
y- y-	0
Well, Dan's got an open notebook, too.	0
discuss - discuss among yourselves.	0
Outrageous!	0
Laying out his  folders.	0
I  have  one but I've carefully  covered  it so that it doesn't -	0
Right.	0
So, this is a project that um	0
has	0
time-aligned spoken	0
data which is um -	0
I see it as sort of  in - between	0
um	0
these  fields	0
because a lot of the time when people do	0
rich um	0
intonational and - and stress-oriented transcription	0
they	0
don't have the	0
digital	0
record	0
at the same time and the don't have it time-aligned.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I  don't  know how large this  is,  actually.	0
But I just	0
was sort of thinking that um	0
I'm - I'm - and it's British	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And you know	0
Well, I  think  to  some  extent with things like	1
So.	0
the  stress  and the other prosodic	1
Uh-huh.	0
things an- and  tighter   time  alignments that we can  do	1
I think	1
we should  probably   do  those	1
Mm-hmm.	0
but  only  once we have a consumer of that data	1
O_K.	0
You know, so  right  now we  have  a  consumer  of	1
the  word  transcripts and the	1
speaker  change.  Me.  I  want  those things to work.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And so I would  like  to get that done as quickly as  possible.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And so,  if -	1
I'm d-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
if  Liz  or someone  else  wants  to do some work on	1
uh	1
prosody  and on  stress  and so on	1
then	1
we can go  back  to the data and generate the	1
uh the transcripts that we need.	1
O_K.	0
One thing about that is that is that	1
um	1
in the process of -	1
of	0
doing the word level?	1
it really  is  just as easy to put the stress in at that point.	1
simply the stressed -	0
Even for an undergrad?	0
Oh, oh, well, see	0
in my pilot	0
stuff, so in the half hour or so that I'm doing.	0
I'd just as soon put it in,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
because I  do  think that you'd find that those would be  words  -	0
O_K.	0
I mean -	0
You know of course,  Rosaria's	0
pursuing this - this  area	0
Mm-hmm.	0
but I  really   do  think	1
from  everything  that  I've  run across that um	1
you -	0
you  should  get  gain	1
in terms of the	1
uh	0
uh	0
what you were saying, the	1
Right.	0
information retrieval aspects from that.	1
And I wouldn't be too surprised - I mean, it's - it's like uh	0
I mean I don't know how - how reliable  Lea  is,	0
but  if  this idea of islands of - of um	0
for di- whatever they	0
are. r-	0
r- islands of reliability or whatever it is.	0
Accuracy?	0
The stressed w-  stressed  words.	0
Certainty, islands of certainty.	1
Is that it?	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
I mean	0
Are you certain?	0
Lea?	0
No.	0
The claim that	1
uh words that get  stressed	1
are easier to recognize.	1
I  see.	0
So,	0
Yeah.	0
I mean, I -	0
I think it c- there's be sort of a  benefit  with  very   minimal   input.	0
Cuz when you  listen  to a sentence,	0
you can  tell  -	0
If it's  contrastive  stress you say "Oh! that word was  stressed "	0
and why the heck  not  put it  in  at the  word  level? So -	0
so, I mean,	0
the part that  I'm  doing, I'm really happy to  supply  that without any -	0
cuz it -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
it's just - it's  there.	0
O_K. If you think it won't slow you down at all.	0
It's not - it doesn't take any thinking.	1
Yeah.	0
I'm not going to talk about, you know	1
uh, trying  grade  them in any kind of careful way, but just  indicate  -	1
if th- if there's a	1
prominent word, to indicate it.	1
Sure.	0
Yeah,  that's  great.	0
All caps.	0
No, well, presumably there's a	0
Whatever.	0
Whatever.	0
an- annotation standard for prefix  characters or something like that. That's what they're using here.	0
People -	0
Yeah, people do different -	0
different ways, a- and so just as long as it's systematic in my view,	0
O_K.	0
you can always	0
Yeah, exactly.	0
filter it into	0
some other format.	0
Exactly.	0
Exactly.	0
Anything else?	0
Well, so, um	0
What  is the plan? We're gonna -	1
I mean,	0
How many -	0
I'm gonna go download "Transcriber" and Jane and I will look at it	0
How many -	0
How many meetings? What about r-	0
our recording schedule?	0
Oh	0
How many meetings are we going to record?	1
Um.	0
Which ones are we going to transcribe?	1
Um.	0
Do we -	0
Well I  think  the  answer  is we need to  record	0
as  many  as we  can.	0
O_K.	0
Right? I don't see any reason  not  to  try  to record	0
a  meeting  or  two  a week.	0
Absolutely.	0
Um.	0
I mean,  more  if we  can.	0
And uh	0
so I wanna -	0
um	0
I wanna  start  by in the  next  couple weeks just doing	0
the Speech group	0
until we get to the point where we're  fairly  comfortable with the  hardware  and the  software  and everything  works.	0
Yeah.	0
and then I think I'll - also uh a- Jerry volunteered to have his group do a few.	0
So, I'll uh	0
try to get those as well.	0
O_K.	0
How many of these do you  have,	1
these  near  mikes?	1
Five.	0
We have  five  of the  wireless.	1
Oh, O_K.	0
O_K.	0
And then we	1
were -	1
going to be  getting  a  bunch  of  wired  ones as  well.	1
I mean notice that	0
n-	0
Well.	0
your -  you  -  you  stood up and  walked   around.   None  of the  rest  of us have.	0
And so we could have  wired  mikes and I wouldn't be a big deal.	0
Oh.	0
Oh,  I  see.	0
for  bigger  meetings.	0
O_K.	0
I see.	0
So.	0
Interesting.	0
Very interesting.	0
Wow,	0
I'm just really impressed by this, um,	0
yeah.	0
It really makes you feel like you're doing  real   work	0
when you get all this  hardware.	0
Well, this is, I mean, compared to the way people	0
normally do, like, discourse stuff? you know, it's like you got your -	0
I mean they've gotten away from w- reel-to-reel tapes, but -	0
Uh-huh.	0
and they  do  have  DAT  recorders,	0
I mean you do have -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
but I mean this is just	0
wonderful, the uh	0
added level of	0
yeah, compactness in the	0
If we can  do  anything with it, yeah.	0
channels.	0
Yep.	0
I  do  find myself  whispering.	0
I mean, I suspect -	0
Why?	0
My  normal  s-.	0
I don't  know  why.	0
I had  noticed  that you were talking quietly, and I was  actually  going to  ask  you.	0
It's bizarre.	0
yeah, this is not really my normal -	0
I was going to  ask  you to speak  up.	0
pattern.	0
But I didn't want you to feel self- conscious.	0
I think the problem is that I'm afraid that I'm talking into someone's  ear.	0
Oh.	0
I  really   do.  So it's - so it's like -	0
And I realize now  that you have volume	0
uh	0
control. But uh	0
Yeah.	0
I  don't feel like you're	0
speaking	0
unnaturally  quietly.	0
Oh good.	0
I mean -  I feel like it's all	0
O_K. Good.	0
quite normal.	0
Well, I  hear  what you're saying.	0
I'm glad.	0
Yeah.	0
Good.	0
Eric's  really got it	0
easy  cuz he's got the  lapel  mike, which is so  unobtrusive.	0
That's  great.	0
I  asked  if somebody else  wanted  the lapel mike.	1
Somebody else can take it next time.	1
I've been  trying  to  rotate  it  through.  So,  Dan  will get it  next  time.	1
Are these  more  expensive or  less  expensive than  this  kind?	0
They're  much  more expensive.	0
O_K.	0
I - I -	0
Which I  don't   understand	0
but there it is.	0
It would be like the television.	0
effect or something, maybe.	0
Right, it's because	0
they make people feel like television stars.	0
Do you  feel  like a  television   star?	0
So you can  charge  more for it.	0
That's  probably why I thought he was the  chairman.	0
Yeah, that's  it.	0
That must be it.	0
That -  that  makes  sense,  right?	0
That's  it!	0
Cuz he's not  heavily   encumbered  with this -	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
N- You should have  run  it  under  your  sweater,  though.	0
Right.	0
Yes.	0
O_K. Well, I don't mind.	0
Oh, we should read some more  numbers,  then.	0
Are we - are we - are we there?	0
Oh good.	0
Yeah.	0
I think we're there.	0
Are we at that point?	0
Good.	0
How much space do we have left?	0
Good.	0
More space than you can -  We've got two hours of space now.	0
uh tons.	0
He - he - he changed the downsampling.	0
Oh  really.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K, so this is Adam, on uh	0
Oh!	0
mike number  two,  wireless headset	0
In  theory. Assuming it's recording  anything.	0
O_K, this is Eric  on	0
microphone number  one,  uh channel  zero	0
Here, here!	0
O_K, this is Jane.	0
O_K.	0
O_K?	0
O_K.	0
Thanks very much.	0
Just control-C_, Dan?	0
Yep.	0
Alrighty.	0
