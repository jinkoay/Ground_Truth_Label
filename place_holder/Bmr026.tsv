Yeah.	0
O_K, we're  on.	0
So, I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have  four  agenda items,  three  of them were	1
requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today.	1
So.	0
The uh  first  was transcription status.  Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is?	0
Um, sort of, I do, peripherally. Um -	1
Is that English?	0
Well first of all with I_B_M I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they	1
That's  our  system.	0
finally made the tape for	1
Ugh!	0
the  thing  that we sent them a  week or week and a half ago and that it's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we'll	1
have the  transcription  back from that.	1
Um -	0
C- can I have a pen?	0
Jane seems to be um	0
moving right along on the	0
transcriptions from the  ICSI  side. She's assigned, I think	0
probably	0
five or six	0
Yeah, I think we're up to M_R thirteen or something.	0
m- more meetings.	0
Yeah, so um, I guess she's hired some new transcribers and -	1
Mmm.	0
Which meetings is she transcribing?	0
Speaking -	0
Um well we've - we've run out of E_D_Us because a certain number of them are um, sort of	0
O_K.	0
awaiting	0
to go to I_B_M.	0
For I_B_M, yeah.	0
O_K.	0
Hmm.	0
and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here.	0
So we're doing some in parallel.	1
So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there's no data back from	0
Yep.	0
No.	0
No, no. We haven't done that process. So. They'r- they're doing the full transcription process.	1
Oh  no no. No. We're not waiting on them.	0
I_B_M no?	0
Oh.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
So they're just doing their own thing until -	0
Because I -	1
We're doing it in parallel, yeah.	0
O_K.	0
I need to ask Jane whether it's - it would be O_K for her -	1
um, s- some of her people to	1
transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection, which is these short like five or seven minute sessions.	1
Yep.	0
Um and we want it - You know, we need -	0
The -  Again,  we - we have a similar uh	0
logistic set-up where we  are  supposed to send the data to Munich and get it transcribed and get it back.	0
Right.	0
But to get  going  we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get  started.	1
Yep, sounds familiar.	0
And so um I wanted to ask Jane if - if	1
uh, you know, maybe one of their	1
transcribers could - could do - I mean since these are very  short,  that should really be uh,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
um -	0
There's only two channels.	0
So it's only - Yeah. As the synthesis doesn't have to be  transcribed  I think. So.	0
It's - Yeah. It's only two -	0
Right, s-	0
Yeah. So - So it's basically one channel to transcribe. And it's - One session is only	0
uh like seven -	0
So that should have ma- many fewer - And it's also not uh- a bunch of interruptions with people and all that, right? So.  Yeah.	0
Right. And  some  of it is  read  speech, so we could give them the -	0
the thing that they're reading and they just may -	0
Make sure it's right.	0
And so um,	0
Yep.	0
um, I guess since she's - I was gonna ask her but since she's not around I - maybe I'll -	0
Yeah, well it certainly seems -	0
Uh if - if that's O_K with you to - to, you know,	0
Yeah.	0
get that stuff uh - to ask her for that, then I'll do that.	0
Yeah, if we're held up on this other stuff a  little  bit in order to encompass that, that's O_K because I- I- um, I mean I still have high hopes that the- that the I_B_M pipeline'll work out for us, so it's -	0
Yeah.	0
O_K, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Alrighty.	0
Oh, yeah, and also related to the  transcription  stuff, so I've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f- showing what the current status is of the trans- of all the things we've collected and what stage each meeting is in, in terms of whether it's -	1
Can you mail that out to the list?	0
Mm-hmm, yeah I will. I - That's the thing that I sent out just to  foo  people saying can you update these pages and so that's where I'm putting it but I'll -	1
Oh, O_K, O_K.	0
I'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it.	1
Yeah, I haven't done that. So. I have lots of stuff to add that's just in my own directory. I'll try to get to that.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K. So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval, but I don't really think there's much to talk about. I'm just gonna do it.  And uh, if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead.	1
You are going to -	0
I'm gonna send out to the participants, uh, with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to	1
suggest edits. And then bleep them out.	1
O_K.	0
For the ones that we have.	0
So but it's just transcripts, not the - not the audio?	1
Um -	0
Nope, they'll have access to the audio also.	1
O_K, yeah, yep. Ah.	0
I mean that's my intention. Because the transcripts might not be right. So you want people to be able to listen to them.	1
Yeah.	0
So -	0
Yeah.	0
So, um the audio that they're gonna have access to, will that be the  uncompressed  version? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and -	1
Oh, that's a good point.	0
That's a good point. Yeah, it's - it's probably going to have to be the  uncompressed  versions because, uh, uh, it takes too long to do random access decompression.	1
Hmm.	0
Yeah, I was just wondering because we're uh running out of the un-backed-up disk space on	1
Well, that was the other point.  Yep, that's another agenda item.	0
Oh, was that another one? O_K. I'll wait.	0
So, uh -	0
But that is a good point so we'll get to that, too. Um, DARPA demo status, not much to say. The back-end stuff is working out fine. It's more or less ready to go. I've added some stuff that uh indes- indexes by the meeting type M_R, E_D_U, et cetera and also by the user I_D.	1
So that the  front-end  can then do  filtering  based on that as well.	1
Uh -	1
The back-end is uh, going more slowly as I s- I think I said before just cuz I'm not much of a Tcl-T_K programmer.	1
And uh Dave Gelbart says he's a little too busy. So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and - and you and I can just talk about it off-line more.	0
Right.	0
But uh  the  back-end  was pretty smooth. So I think, we'll have something. It may not be as -	0
Oh-	0
As pretty as we  might  like, but we'll have something.	0
I wondered whe- when we would reach Dave's saturation point. He's sort of been - been volunteering for everything and  and uh -	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_ K.  Finally said he was too  busy.   I guess we  reached  it.	0
Yeah, he - he actually - he volunteered but then he s- then he retracted it. So. Oh well.	0
Um -	0
And, also um,	1
I was just showing Andreas, I got um an X_Waves	1
kind of display, and I don't know how much more we can do with it - with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom so, right now it's just an X_Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know, it looked pretty nice and I'm sure it - think it has potential for	1
Oh, cool.	0
For a demo?  Yeah, sounds good.	0
a little something, yeah, for a demo.	0
So -	0
O_K, so again, the issue is - For July, the issue's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine, uh, and so on, but -	0
Oh.  O_K.	0
So it might just be slides.	0
Yeah, O_K. Well, we'll see, um -	0
Well -   Yeah.	0
I've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i- And I installed it on Dave Gelbart's P_C and it worked just fine. So hopefully that will work.	1
Really? So is that -	0
Because there's some people um -	0
It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at - at S_R_I because the um -	0
Yeah.	0
Yep.	0
Well	1
we have m- m- We have more Windows machines to run the -	0
Transcriber is Tcl-T_K, very generic with Snack, so basically anything you can get Snack to run on, it will work.	1
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah but - But the problem is	1
the version Transcriber works with, the Snack version, is one point six whatever and that's not anymore supported. It's not on - on the web page anymore. But I just wrote an email to - to the author of - to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library and so it works.	1
Well I thought it was packaged with  Transcriber?	0
Yeah, but then you can't add our patches and then	0
Oh.	0
the - the new version is - is totally different a- and in - yeah, in terms of - of the source code. You - you can't find the Tcl files anymore. It's some whatever wrapped thing and you can't - you can't access that so	0
Ah.	0
Mmm.	0
you have to install - First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and  then	0
do the patches. Yeah.	0
Patch. Ugh!	0
I - I wonder if - if we should	0
contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along - We have? Oh.	0
Yeah.	0
We have -  Yeah b- it's just hasn't made it into the release yet.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
So did you um	0
put the uh -  the N_T version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page? Or -	0
No, I haven't done that yet. I'm -  oh  Nope.	0
But I definitely will do that.	0
So, can some of the stuff that Don's talking about somehow fit into this	0
Uh, mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, it's basically ASCII files or binary files, whatever representation. Just three different - It's a waveform and	0
So -	0
just a stylized pitch vector basically so it's -	0
So - So - Well -	0
I mean we could do it in Matl-  I mean you could do it in a number of different places I'm sure.	0
But - But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the - you know, maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary	1
Yep.	0
Yeah.	0
valued function that is - that is you know time synchron- ti-	1
Yeah, that'd be very cool.	0
Yes.	0
It'd be easy enough to add that. Again it's - it's  It's more Tcl-T_ K  programming. So someone who's familiar with Tcl-T_K has to do it, but uh, it wouldn't be hard to do.	0
ti- time synchronous with the waveform.	1
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed. S- Right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yep.	0
Yep.	0
Yeah.  Yeah, maybe we could l- look into that.	0
Yeah.	0
But it - it seems to me that	0
And -	0
I c-	0
It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary. So yo- It seems to me you could do images.	0
Um  What do you mean by real time? Do you mean like -	0
Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo.	0
O_K.	0
Is that what you mean? Yeah.	0
Yeah, jus-  Yeah.  It just seems to me jus-	0
It would be cool to see it - It would be cool like to see -	0
to hear it and see it, and see the pitch contours also.	1
And to  hear  it. Yeah. Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Sure, but I don't think - I - You can do all that just statically in PowerPoint.	0
I think it would lose -	0
Yeah, I mean y-	0
Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that's -	1
Right, right.	0
I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just	0
like	0
um  view  graphs or something.	0
You know, wh- Yeah. So. Uh, no, we're talking about on the computer and - and um, I think when we were talking about this before we had littl- this little demo meeting, we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have	0
Right.	0
and,  the more live, the better, but uh, given the crunch of time, we may have to retreat from it to some extent. So I think -	1
For a  lot  of reasons, I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it so it'd be a good thing to get in there. But,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
um -  Anyway,  jus- just looking for ways that we could actually show what you're doing, uh,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
in -  to people.	0
Cuz a lot of this stuff,  particularly  for Communicator, uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th- originally had t- had to do with prosodics	0
It'd  be nice to show that we can actually get them and	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mmm.	0
see them.	0
And the last i- item on the agenda is disk issues yet again. So, we're doing O_K on backed up. We're - We're only about thirty percent on the second disk.	1
So, uh,	1
we have a  little  bit of time before that becomes critical, but we are like ninety five percent, ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings.	1
Yeah.	0
And, my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space, but unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data	1
all at once, in a lot of different ways.	1
Yeah.	0
Oh there's a lot of  transcribers,  too.	0
Yeah, there're a lot of transcribers, so all of those need to be expanded, and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh, uh,	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
An-	0
Right.	0
uh, the permission forms, so I want those to be live, so there's a lot of data that has to be around.	0
Um -	0
And Jane was gonna talk to, uh, Dave Johnson about it. One of the things I was thinking is we - we just got these hundred - alright, excuse me - ten, uh	0
SPARC-Blade	0
Did they come in?	0
SUN-Blades. They came in but they're not set up yet. And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those	0
SUN-Blades. Yeah. They came in the other day.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh.	0
because they'll be in the machine room, they'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines.	0
And if we just need un-backed-up space, we could just hang disks off them.	0
Well, is there - Why not just hang  them   off of Abbott, is there a -	0
Yeah.	0
Because there's no more room in the  disk  racks on Abbott.	0
Ah.	0
Ah, I see.	0
Weren't we gonna get - Well, maybe it should get another rack.	1
But you  still  need to  store  the  disks  somehow.	0
Well, but the SUN-Blades have spare drive bays.	0
So -	0
Just put them in.	0
You can put two -	0
Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the -	0
Internal. Yeah.	0
Sure.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh.	0
Cuz the SUN - uh, these SUN-Blades take commodity hard drives. So you can just go out and buy a P_C hard drive and stick it in.	0
Mmm.	0
But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it - it -  file  server  it seems like we would want to get it, uh, a second disk rack or something.	0
Plus we're talking about buying a second dis- uh,  file  server.	0
Well, I mean there are  lots  of long term solutions. What I'm looking for is where do we s- expand the next meeting?	0
Yep.	0
I see    Oh,  I  see.	0
Well, for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those  ten,  mightn't you? Uh, you know Dave Johnson is gone for, like, ten days,	1
Oh, I didn't know he had left already.	0
Uh, well, tonight.	0
Oh, oh well.	0
You mean he won't set up the - mmm.	0
How much space do you need for these?	0
I don't know. I don't know what his schedule is. I'm just saying he's gone.	0
You - we need about a gig per meeting.	1
I - I thi-	0
Yep.	0
I have um - I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer.	1
Alright! What's your computer's name?	0
So -	0
You  had  an eighteen gigabyte drive.	0
Uh, Samosa.	0
Yeah, I  had.  Well it's about - I think there's about twelve gig left.	0
So it - And you have an X_ drives installed? O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
So, I didn't realize it was so critical. I mean I'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri- or that are - new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything.	0
And you're o- you're offering?	0
O_K.	0
I - I jus- I just gave Thilo some - about ten gigs, the last ten gigs of space that there was on - on uh Abbott.	0
Um not that I can't do anything, I jus-	0
Uh -	0
And uh - So but that - But -	0
Which one was that, X_  G_? O_K.	0
X_G.	0
X_G.	0
Yeah.	0
X_G?	0
That's also where we store the -	0
The uh Hub-five training set waveforms, right?	0
Oops.	0
No. I don't think that's on X_G. On X_G is only Carmen and Du- and Stephane's disk.	0
But that won't be getting any bigger, will it?	0
Right.	0
It's - Yeah.	0
But I've also been storing - I've been storing the  feature  files there and I guess I can s- start deleting some because we now know what the best features are and we won't be using the old ones anymore.	0
Well -	0
Yeah, I do- I don't think it was on X_G. I th-	0
I have a lot of space, though.	0
Uh -	0
Isn't that X_H?	0
I have a lot of space and it's not - it's n- There's very little uh - Yeah not for long. But I mean it's not going f- It's not being used often at all.	0
Not - not for long.	0
Oh that's X_A - Oh that's X_ -	0
Maybe I'm confu- Oh no I'm sorry.	0
But I'm using X_H - H_, too. So.	0
Yeah, it's probably - Probably only about four gig is on X_ - on your X_ drive, but we'll definitely take it up if you -	0
Oh O_K.	0
I th-	0
I think you're right. It's  X_H  and D_ - The b- I'm also using  D_G  I got that confused. O_K.	0
I think it's about four or five gig cuz I have  four   meetings on there, three or four meetings.	0
Great.	0
So.	0
We need -	0
O_K, so that will get us through the next couple days.	0
We need another gigaquad.	0
Yep.  At least.	0
O_K.	0
There should - I d- There should just be a b- I should have a button.	0
Just press - Press each meeting saying "we need more disk space"  "this week". Skip the rest of the conversation.	0
The "more disk space" button?  Yep.	0
Well we've collected so far something like	0
uh sixty-five meetings.	0
And - And how much does each meeting take?	0
And it's	0
about a gig uncompressed.	0
It's - It's a little bit more as I usually don't - do not uncompress the - all of the P_Z_M and the P_D_A things. So.	0
Is a little more?	0
Right, yeah so if you uncompressed  everything  it's even  more.  U- Uh  compressed  how much are they? Like -	0
It's -	0
Yeah.	0
One point five or something.	0
Half a gig.  For all of them.	0
About half?	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah. Yep.	0
So we're definitely are storing	0
you know, all of those.	0
So there's what thirty some gig	0
So- so- So maybe there's a hundred  gig or something. Or -	0
of just meetings so far?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I mean. Cuz we - we have the uncompressed around also. So it's like -	0
Right. Right. Well we - We haven't uncompressed all the meetings, but -	0
Yeah.	0
I would  like  to.	0
Yeah. Well I mean it's - the- they really are cheap. I mean it's just a question of figuring out  where  they should  be  and  hanging  them, but	1
Right.	0
Yep.	0
But uh, we could - You know, if you want to get four disks, get four disks. I mean it's - it's small - I mean these things ar- are just a few hundred dollars.	0
Yeah. Well I sent that message out to, I guess, you and Dave asking for - if we could get some disk. I s- I sent this out	1
Yeah.	0
And put it  where?	0
Right.	0
a - a day ago but - and Dave didn't respond so I don- I don't know	0
how the whole process  works.  I mean does he just go out and  get  them and - if it's O_K, and -	0
Yep.	0
So I was  assuming  he was gonna take over  that. But he's probably too busy given that he's leaving.	0
Yeah, I think you need a direct conversation with him. And just  say an-e- just ask him that, you know, wha- what should you do. And in my answer back was "are you sure you just want one?" So I mean I think	0
Yeah.	0
that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure "well, here's what we pi- figure on doing for the next few months".	0
Wa- a- I  know  what  they  want. The  sysadmins  would prefer to have  one  external drive per  machine.	1
So they don't want to stack up external drives.	1
Yeah.	0
Um -	0
And then they want everything else in the  machine  room.	0
Right.	0
So the question is where are you gonna  hang  them?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I don't know what the  space  situation is in the  machine  room.	0
Right.	0
So.	0
Right. So this is a question that's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave, cuz it -	1
Th- The -	0
I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the - the  new  machines up is because he doesn't have room in the  machine  room right now. So he has to re- arrange  a bunch of stuff.	1
One -	0
Mmm.	0
Yep.	0
One - One	0
On- One thing to in- to um t- to do when you need to conserve space is	0
I bet there are still some old, uh, like, nine gig disks, uh,	0
around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and - and you know recover the space.	0
Yep.	0
Yeah. No. I think Dave - Dave knows all these things, of course. An- and so, he always has a- a lot of plans of things that he's gonna do to make things better in many ways an- and runs out of time.	0
Right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
But I - I know that   generally  their first priority has been for backed up disk. And so I think what he's been concentrating on is uh	1
Mmm.	0
the back - the	1
back up system, rather than on new disk. So.	1
Mmm.	0
Well. So. But this - this is a very specific question for me. Basically, we can easily get	0
Which -	0
one to four disks, I mean you just go out and get four and we've got the money for it, it's no big deal.	0
Uh, but the question is where they go, and I don't think we can solve that here, you just have to ask him.	0
Maybe we can put some disks in the - in that back room there.	0
Yeah really.	0
Attach to -	0
Popcorn.	0
To the machine that collects the  data.  So then you could, at least  temporarily,  store stuff  there.  The only -	0
Yeah?	0
Hmm.	0
Yeah, it's just - It's not on the net, so it's a little  awkward  It's not -	0
What do you mean it's not on the net?	0
It's not bad.	0
It's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S_S_H Yep.	0
Oh because it's - because it's an ACIRI machine? Oh, oh oh.	0
Yeah.	0
And  also  on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net, but	0
Who  knows  when that will happen?	0
That  might  be a good	0
But  that  can't be that hard. I mean -	0
short  term solution, though.	0
No, the - the  problem  with that apparently is that they don't currently have a  wire	0
running to that back room  that goes anywhere near one of the  ICSI  routers.	0
Oh,    hhh.	0
So, they actually have to run a wire	0
somewhere.	0
@@	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, e- again, you know, any one of these things is certainly not a big deal. If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it's - it's - jus- every- ever- everybody - everybody has a - has -	0
But Dave has to do all of them.	0
Well all of us have long lists of different things we're doing.	0
But at any rate I think that there's a - there's a  longer  term thing and there's  immediate  need and I think we need a - a conversation with -	1
Uh, maybe - maybe after - after tea or something you and I can go down and - and talk to him about it  Just say "wha- you know, what should we do right now?"	0
How long is David gonna be gone?	0
Uh, eleven days or something?	0
Oh my!	0
Yeah basically tomorrow and all of  the week after.	0
And that's all I have.	0
Um -	0
Let's see. The only oth- thing - other thing I was gonna add was that um -	0
uh, I talked briefly to Mari and uh we	0
had  both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the  last meeting we had here	0
but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting	0
the Friday after next.	0
And I - I - I wanted to make it, um	0
after the next one of  these  meetings, so something that we wanna	1
do next meeting is - is uh to	1
put together um, a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it,	1
um,	1
that	1
we've done.	1
I mean just sort of	1
bulletize I mean o- e- do- do- I can - I can dream up text but  this is basically gonna lead to the annual report.	1
So  Um - If w-	1
Mm-hmm.	0
This is the fifteenth?	0
Um, that would	0
So just a week from tomorrow?  O_K.	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
So, uh, we can - This - So that's an -	0
Is this gotta be in the morning?	0
Um -	0
Or - Because you know I - Fridays I have to leave uh	0
like around uh two.	0
So if it could be before that would be be-	0
No, no but I - I - I don't need other folks for the meeting. I can do it. A- A- All I'm saying is that  on  -	0
Oh, O_K, alright. Oh I'm sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you are -	0
Yeah so what I meant was on the me-  this  meeting	0
O_K.	0
if I wa- something I - I - I'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we've done so I can tell her.	0
Alright.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I think I have a pretty good idea but - but um -	0
O_K.	0
Uh, and then the next day uh, late in the day I'll	0
be having that - that discussion with her.	0
Mmm.	0
Um.	0
So.	0
Um - Uh - One thing - I mean - we -	1
in past meetings we had um	1
also a-  you know  various - variously talked about the um work that	1
w- uh was happening sort of on the - on the recognition side um but isn't necessarily	1
Mm-hmm.	0
related to  meetings  uh specifically. So. Um. And	0
I wondered whether we should	0
maybe have um a  separate  meeting and between	0
you know, whoever's interested in that	0
because I feel that uh  there's  plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of	0
um	0
maybe the  wrong  place to do it in  this  meeting if uh -	0
Think so?	0
Well, it's that -	1
It's just	1
gonna be ver- very  boring  for people who are not	1
you know, sort of	1
really  interested  in the  details  of the	1
recognition  system.	1
I'm interested.	0
Me too.	0
Well, O_K, so how many - how many people here would  not  be interested in uh - in a meeting about recognition?	1
w-	0
Jane  may not be.	0
Jane,  I think.	0
Well I know - Well, Jane an-	0
Yep.	0
Well you mean in a  separate  meeting or ha- ha- talking about it in this -	0
No. If we talked about it in  this  meeting.	0
He's  wondering  how much  overlap  there will be.	0
Yeah, so you're su- So.	0
O_K.	0
So, uh,	0
uh,  Liz  and  Jane  probably.	1
O_K, so we're gonna have a  guy's  meeting.	0
Uh.	0
Good thing Liz isn't here.	0
Real -	0
Uh, if you wanna put it  that  way.	0
Watch a ball game?	0
Wh-	0
Don't  listen to this, Liz.	0
Yeah, real - real - real men	0
"Real men do decoding" or something like that.	0
Right.	0
Uh.	0
I mean it- it's sort of -	0
Yeah.	0
I mean when - when the talk is about data collection	0
stuff, sometimes  I've  -	0
The - Nod off?	0
you know, I -  I'm  bored. So it's I c- I can sympathize with them not wanting to -	0
It's cuz  y- you have a -	0
i- to - to be uh - you know - If - I cou- you know - this could -	0
So you need a better developed  feminine  side.	0
I'm not sure I wanna -	0
There's probably gonna be a lot of "bleeps" in this meeting.	0
Yeah, I would as-  I would guess.	0
Uh.	0
Yeah  and -	0
Um.	0
I think it  must  be  uh nearing the end of the week.	0
Um.	0
Yeah.	0
I -	0
You know, I - I've heard some comments about like this. That m-  could  be. I mean the - Um.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And we don't have to do it every week. We could do it every  other  week or so. You know, whatev- or whenever we feel like we -	0
Could we -	0
Right, I was -	0
Why don't we alternate this meeting every other  week?	1
Or just alternate the focus.	0
U-	0
Tha-  That's  what I mean.	0
Yeah, so on even weeks have  basic  on data.	0
Yeah.	0
We could do that, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
I - I -  Personally  I'd - I'm  not  in favor of more  meetings.	0
Um.	0
Right.	0
Because, uh.  You know.	0
I  am.	0
Oh sor-	0
But I do- I don't - I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on  Meeting  Recorder. So if we did that -	1
Right.	0
Well, except that we keep going for our full time.	0
Yep.	0
Well, cuz we get into these other  topics.	0
Yeah.	0
We feel - We feel obligated to collect more data.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Ugh.	0
So if we could  alternate  the focus of the  meeting  -	0
I don't. Let's read digits and go.	0
Why don't we just  start  with that. And then if we find, you know we're just not getting enough done, there's all these topics not coming up, then we can expand into another meeting. But I - I think that's a great idea.	1
ummh.	0
ummh.  O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh.	1
So uh.	1
Um.	1
Let's chat about it with Liz and Jane  when we get a chance, see what they think and -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah that would be good. I mean Andreas and I have	0
various talks in the halls and there's lots of	0
Mm-hmm.	0
things, you know, details and stuff that would I think people'd be interested in and I'd - you know, where do we go from here kind of things and -	0
So, it would be good.	0
Yeah, and you're - you're attending	0
the uh - the front-end meeting as well as the others so you have - you have	0
probably one of the best -  you and I, I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two. We  are  doing recognition in both of them. So.	0
Bridge.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
Uh.	0
So um.	0
O_K?	0
So - so we could talk a  little  bit about that  now  if - if there's some time.	0
No, no that would be for  next  week.	0
Um I jus- So the  latest  result was that um	0
um	1
yot	0
I tested the uh - the	1
sort of final version of the P_L_P	1
configuration	1
um on development test data for - for this year's Hub-five test set.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And the	1
recognition performance was	1
exactly,  and I mean  exactly  up to the - you know, the first decimal, same as with the	1
uh Mel Cepstra	1
front-end.	1
Mmm.	0
For both females and males?	0
Yes.	0
Oh!	0
Uh, well i- there was a little bit of a -	0
i-  overall.	1
They - They were - The  males  I think were slightly better and the  females  were slightly worse but nothing really. I mean definitely not significant.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And then the really nice thing was that if - if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent  improvement.	1
Wow.	0
So.	0
Just with ROVER?	0
t- With N_best ROVER, which is like our  new and  improved  version of ROVER.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Which u- actually uses the whole N_best list from both systems  to  mmm, uh  c- combine that.	1
So except - I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the	0
auto-regressive versus the	0
Yeah.	0
cepstral truncation.  O_K.	0
And, the -	0
But a percent and a half? That's -	0
Yeah, it's pretty  impressive.	0
And - And so uh after I told the - my uh colleagues at S_R_I about that, you know,	0
now they definitely want to, you know, uh, have a - Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh, you know, basically a- at least the system combination.	0
Um, and, you know, why not? Uh.  So.	0
Sure, why not?	0
We clearly gotta add a few more features, though.	0
Uh w- what do you mean? More features in the sense of front-end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles?	0
No, uh front-end features.	0
You know we did P_L_P and Mel Cepstra. Let's, you know, try RASTA and M_S_G, and -	0
Oh I mean - Yeah. Well  Right. So, we cou- Yeah. That's - the - the	0
the - There's  one  thing uh - I mean you don't want to overdo it because y- every  front-end  - You know, if you - you know you basically multiply your effort by N_, where N_ is a number of different	1
Oh.	0
systems and - Um. So.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
So one - one	0
compromise would be to -	0
only	0
to have the - everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then	0
after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that's a fairly painless um thing. So.	0
Mmm.	0
An-	0
Do you think we'd still get the one and a half uh -	0
I - I think so. Yeah. Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if - You know, maybe it's only  one  percent or something but that would  still  be worthwhile doing.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So.	0
Um  Jus- You know, just wanted to let you know that that's working out very nicely.	0
Cool.	0
And then we had some results on  digits, uh,	1
with um - We - We - So this was uh	1
really    - really sort of just to get Dave going with his um	0
experiments. And so,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh. But as a  result,  um, you know, we were sort of wondering why is the	0
Hub-five system doing so well on the  digits.  And the reason is basically there's a whole bunch of read  speech  data in the Hub- five  training set. And you c-	1
Right.	0
Right.	0
Including digits I gather, yeah.	0
And - Not all of - No it's actually, digits is only a maybe a fifth of it. The rest is - is read - is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that.	1
A fifth of it is how much?	0
Right. But a fi- a fifth is how much?	0
A fifth would be maybe	1
uh two hours something.	1
Yeah, so I mean that's actually not that different from the  amount of training that there was. So.	1
Right.	0
But it definitely helps to have the  other  read data in there  because we're doing -	1
Oh yeah  w-	0
You know the error rate is  half  of what you do if you train only on ti- uh  TIMIT  -  uh not TIMIT uh T_I- digits,  which is only what two hours something?	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
I don't know.	0
So.	1
Uh, more read speech data definitely  helps.  And you can leave out all the  conversational  data with no performance penalty. That's e- That was e- Right, right.	1
Yeah  that  was the interesting thing. Because - because uh, it was  apparent  if you put in a bunch more data it would be better, but - but uh.	1
Right.	0
Well is there even  more   read   speech  data around?	0
Oh, yeah. So we only - for the Hub-five training, we're only using uh a fairly small subset of the  Macrophone   database.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um, so, you could beef that up and probably do even  better.	0
I could also put in  uh	0
Mm-hmm.	0
focus condition zero from Hub-four	0
from Broadcast News,	0
which is mostly prepared speech.	0
It's not exactly  read  speech but it's pretty darn close.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Well, I mean that's  plenty  of read  speech  data. I mean, Wall Street Journal,  uh, take one example.	1
Yeah.	0
That's right.	0
But um.	0
So, you know that might be useful for the people who train the - the digit recognizers to - to use uh something other than T_I-digits.	1
Yeah.	0
Well they been using TIMIT.	0
O_K.	0
That - Uh.	0
They - they uh - they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they're multilingual tests and - and uh,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um, - and actually the  best  results they got wa- were uh using TIMIT.	0
Hmm.	0
Uh -	0
But uh - which - So that's what they're - they're using now. But - but yeah certainly if we,	0
Mmm.	0
um -	0
If we knew what the  structure  of what we're doing there  was.  I mean there's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms. So we don't know exactly which combination we're gonna be going with.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Once we  know,  then - the  trainable  parts of it - it'd be great to run	0
lots of - lots of stuff through.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
Well, that was that. And then I th- guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem	1
uh system and -	1
You wanna -  You wanna see where that  stands ?  @@	0
Well, I'm - Yeah, so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the S_R_I system uses. And so I'm in the process of um	1
converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train	1
uh a new net with. And uh so then I'll train the net. And.	1
An- And one side effect of that would be that it's - um that the phone set would change. So the M_L_P would be trained on I think only forty-six or forty-eight - forty-eight phones?	1
Right.	0
Eight.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh which is smaller than the um	1
than the phone set that - that we've been using so far.	1
Yeah.	0
And that - that -  that  will probably  help,  actually, because	0
So it's a little different?	0
um the fewer dimensions uh e- the less trouble probably with the - as far as just the um,	0
um -	0
Just - You know we want to try things like  deltas  on the  tandem  features. And so you h- have to multiply everything by two or three. And so, you know,	1
fewer dimensions in the  phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view.	1
Sure. Although we - I mean, it's not  that  many fewer and - and - and we take a K_L_T anyway so we could - Yeah.	1
Right.	0
Exactly. So - so that was the  other  thing. And then we wanted to s- just limit it to maybe	1
uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um	1
front-end.  So	1
that would mean  just  doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the K_L_T	1
Yeah, and I think - and we sh- again check - we should check with Stephane. My impression was that when we did that before that had very little - uh he didn't lose very much.	0
dimensions.	1
Right.	0
By just taking the top whatever?	0
Yep.	0
Yeah  yeah.	0
But then - And then  something  - Once we  have  the new M_L_ P  trained up,	1
uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on	1
you know, those features uh and uh retrain M_L_P and also the	1
you know, the  dictionary  that we use for the Hub- five  system.	1
And the b- And the base u- starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i- from a pretty decent system.	1
Exactly.	0
Right.	0
Yeah. So	0
Yeah.	0
that would basically give us a, um, more -  hopefully  a - a	0
better  system	0
um because - you know, compared to what Eric did a while ago, where he trained up, I think, a system based on Broadcast News and then	0
uh tra- retraining it on  Switchboard  or s- uh and -	0
Yeah.	0
But he - I think he d- he didn't -	0
he probably didn't use  all  the training data	0
that was available. And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um	0
conversational speech as - as the -	0
as  ours  is. So.	0
That's - That's certainly  one  thing, yeah. Uh.	0
And the  dictionary  made a huge difference. Uh. We - we made some	0
Yeah.	0
improvements to the dictionary's uh - to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a -	0
uh something like a four percent absolute	0
error rate reduction on Switchboard, which -	0
Well the  other  thing is, dipping	0
deep into history and into uh our resource management days,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
when we were collaborating with S_R_I  before,  uh	0
Mmm. Mm-hmm.	0
it was - I  think,  it is was a really key	0
uh  starting  point for us that we actually got our alignment. When  we  were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh  at the  time.   Uh.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
And.  Later  we got  away  from it because - because once we had decent  systems  going	0
Mm-hmm.	0
then it was - it was typically better to use our  own  systems cuz they were self- consistent but - but certainly to start off when we were	0
trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate. Uh.  But that was a - that was a good - good - good way to  start.	0
Yeah.	0
And we're not  quite  that bad with our - our Switchboard systems but it was - they certainly aren't as good as S_R_I's, so -	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
W- What  is  the performance on s- the best Switchboard system that we've done?	0
Right.	0
Roughly?	0
Well, the  hybrid  system we never got better than about fifty percent	0
error. And uh it was -  I think there's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for. We never  did  really	0
fix up the dictionary.	0
Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and - and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did.	0
Yeah.	0
Mmm.	0
But that w- Even  that  - that number -	0
Uh, we never did an- never did any adaptation  uh, we never did any -	0
Right.	0
And - And  that  number I think was on  Switchboard-one  data, right?	0
Where the error rate now is in the  twenties.	0
So, um.	0
Yeah. Yeah.	0
So we were - Yeah. We were	0
That's yet s-	0
probably at least a factor or two off.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
So it would be - So it would be good t- to sort of r- re- uh - just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
But I think - again it's -	0
Yeah. It's the conver- it's the s-	0
conversational speech bit.	0
Because our - our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good.  He knows .	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
And the  other  thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M_L_ P  is trained up. Right?	0
Because it's a pretty good um	0
Mm-hmm.	0
indicator of that.	0
So it's sort  of a sanity check of the M_L_ P  outputs  before we go ahead and train up the -	1
uh you know, use them as a basis for the tandem system.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah. It'll  still  probably be worse. I mean, it's - it'd be context independent and so on. But.	1
No.	0
Sure.	0
Should we - Should we bother with um using the net	0
Not - But -	0
before doing uh embedded	0
training?	0
I mean should - should we even  use  that? Or should I just go straight to -	0
Oh  oh  that's  a good question. Yeah, we - we weren't sure whether it's worth to just use the alignments um	0
from the S_R_ I  recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign.	0
Try it.	0
You run it? Keep - keep both versions? See which one's better?	0
Uh, yeah. I mean. I think I agree with Ad-	0
I mean basically you would then - You  proceed  with the embedded training. It's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway. And while it's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it  did.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
O_K.	0
Mmm.	0
Alright.	0
I could make arguments either way. You know, it's - Sort of given up guessing.	0
But - But so I - Well but i- But in your experience I mean uh have you seen	0
big improvements in s- on some tasks with embedded training? Or was it sort of small-ish uh improvements that you got-	0
Uh well. It depended on the task. I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important because we're coming from	0
Right.	0
uh, alignments that were achieved with an  extremely  different system.	0
That are from another -	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
Although,	0
Uh.	0
I mean we've done it with - When we were combining with the Cambridge  recurrent  neural net, embedded training made it  worse.	0
Which I've never figured out.	0
Right. But I mean i-	0
I think it's a bug.	0
So you - you started training with outputs from a - with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system?	1
Yep.	0
And then -	1
Uh. Hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Well, that might probably just - Hmm. That was  probably  because your initial  system  - I mean  your  system was ba- worse than Cambridge's.	1
And you -	0
Um.	0
Was it? I don't think it was.	0
No they were - they were comparable.	1
It wasn't?	0
No.	0
Really?	0
They were very close.	0
Yeah.	0
That's  weird.	0
Excuse me?	0
That's - That's  weird.	0
That's  what  I  said.	0
Oh!	0
No I mean it's weird that it did - I'm sorry. It's w-   It's weird that it got worse.	0
That's  ambiguous.	0
Um. No. Uh.	0
Tha- u- we- we've see- I mean - and wi- with the numbers - O_G_I numbers task we've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better.	0
Oh actually it's not  that  weird because we have seen -	0
We have seen cases where acoustic - retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better.	0
Yeah. It just -	0
Yeah.	0
But I- But I would - I would  suspect  that something that - that had um a very different	0
Um	0
feature set, for instance - I mean they were using pretty diff- similar feature sets to us.	0
Yep.	0
I - I would expect that something that had a different feature set would - would uh benefit from -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
What about uh  hidden  unit size  on this.  Oh.	0
Oh, wait a minute, and the other thing uh, sorry, it was - the other thing is that what was in  common	0
to the Cambridge system and our system is they  both  were training posteriors.	0
Right.	0
So I mean, uh,  that's  another pretty big difference and	0
Ah  yeah. That's another big difference.	0
uh, one bac- at least -	0
Back at -	0
You mean with soft targets?	0
Or - ?	0
Sorry, I'm sor- I missed - What - What's the key issue here?	0
Oh, that uh	0
both the Cambridge system and our system were - were training	0
posteriors. And if we're - we're coming from alignments coming from the S_R_I system, it's a  likelihood-based  system.	0
So - so that's  another  difference. I mean. You know, there's diffe- different front-end	0
Yeah.	0
different - different uh, um,	0
training criterion -	0
Uh, I would  think  that in a- that an embedded  uh	0
embedded uh	0
training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more. But we don't know.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
You gonna say something?	0
Yeah. I was wondering uh you know what	1
size net I should -	1
Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions?	1
Uh, how much training data?	1
Well, I was gonna start off with the  small  train set.	0
And how - How many hours is that?	0
That's why I was - I - I'm not sure how much that is.	0
Uh, I think that has about -	0
Well i- you'd - would be gender-dependent training, right? So - So I think it's - uh that's about	0
Gender-dependent, yeah.	0
mmm, something like thirty hours.	0
Thirty hours.	0
Thirty hours per gender.	0
I'm not sure what  this'll  mean.	0
In the small training set?	0
I - I  think  so. I'll -	0
Hello?	0
Excuse me?	0
It's definitely less than a hundred - You know, it's more like -	0
Alright.	0
like thirty forty hours something like that.	0
Wrong number.	0
They called to tell us that?	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Um. So. Uh.	0
I mean, I  didn't  want to do  too  big, just -	0
after run-	0
Right. So  At least a couple thousand hidden units.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I mean. It's - it's th- the thing I'll - I'll think about it a little more but it - it'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand.	0
Mmm.	0
You  definitely  wouldn't want the eight thousand. It's m- It's more than -	0
And a  thousand  is too  small?	0
Oh let me think about it, but I think that - that uh th- at some point there's diminishing returns.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I mean it doesn't actually get worse, typically, but it - but - but there is diminishing returns and you're doubling  the amount of time.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Remember you'll have a smaller  output  layer so there's gonna be fewer parameters there. And then -	0
But  not  by a  lot.	0
Not  by  much.  Fifty s- Fifty four to forty eight?	0
Vast majority is from the input unit.	0
O_K. Yeah.	0
Yeah. Yeah. It'll have a very tiny effect.	0
Right, because you used the  context  windows  and so the input to hidden is much, much larger.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh  I  see,  I  see, yeah, of course. Yeah. It's negligible, O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, so it's - it'd be way,  way  less than ten percent of the difference.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Uh.	0
There's uh -	0
How bi- how big	0
Let's see. What am I trying to think of?	0
The - The  net  that - that we  did  use already  uh was eight thousand hidden units and that's the one that  Eric  trained up.	0
