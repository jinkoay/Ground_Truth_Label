Thanks.	0
Are you Fey? Oh. Hi. I think we've met before, like, I remember talking to you about Aspect or something like that at some point or other. So.	0
I am Fey, yeah. Hi.	0
What day is today?	0
A couple times yeah. That's right, yeah.	0
It's the uh twenty -	0
Nineteenth?	0
nineteenth.	0
And you were [MASK] briefly,	0
@@	0
Right, right.	0
until I dropped the class.	0
Oh that's  right.	0
But.	0
Well.	0
No offense.  Like.	0
O_K, wh- wh- Yeah. O_K. Some in- some introductions are in order.	0
Oh, O_K sorry.	0
Getting  ahead of  myself.	0
O_K. So. Um. For those who don't know - Everyone knows me, this is great. Um, apart from that, sort of the old gang, Johno and Bhaskara have been with us from - from day one and um	0
Yay!	0
Hi.	0
they're engaged in - in various activities, some of which you will hear about today.  Ami is um our counselor and spiritual guidance and um also interested in problems concerning reference of the more complex type,	0
Well.	0
Oh wow.	0
and um he sits in as a interested participant and helper.	0
Is that a good characterization? I don't know.	0
u- That's pretty good, I think. Yeah.  Thanks.	0
O_K.	0
Keith is not technically one of us yet,  ha-ha.	0
Not yet.	0
"One of us."	0
but um it's too late for him now. So.	0
Yeah right. I've got the  headset  on after all.	0
Um. Officially I guess he will be joining us in the summer.	0
yes.	0
And um hopefully it is by - by means of Keith that we will be able to get a b- a better formal and a better semantic um idea of what a construction is and um how we can make it work for us. Additionally his interest um surpasses um English because it also entails German, an extra capability of speaking and writing and understanding and reading	0
that language.	0
And um, is there anyone who doesn't know Nancy?	0
I made that joke already, Nancy, sadly.  The "I don't know myself" joke.	0
Do you - do you know Nancy? O_K.	0
Me?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I know Nancy.	0
What?	0
You did? When?	0
Uh before you came in.	0
Oh.	0
About  me  or  you?	0
Man!	0
About  me.	0
O_K.  O_K.	0
You  could  do it about  you.	0
Well I didn't  know.  I didn't mean to be humor copying, but O_K, sorry.	0
Yeah.	0
Yes, I know myself. It's O_K. It's a -	0
O_K. And um Fey is with us as of six days ago officially? Officially, but in reality already um much much longer and um	0
Officially, yeah.	0
um next to some - some more or less bureaucratic uh stuff with the - the data collection she's also the wizard in the data collection	0
Of Oz.	0
Um, we're sticking with the term "wizard", O_K.	0
It's very exciting.	0
Yes. Yes.	0
and um	0
Not witch-like.	0
Wizardette.	0
Wizard.	0
Wizardess.	0
Sorceress, I think.	0
O_K.	0
Wizard.	0
wizard uh by by popular vote um	0
O_K.	0
Didn't take a vote? O_K.	0
O_K, um, why don't we get started on  that  subject	0
anyways.	0
Um, so we're about to collect data and um	0
the uh s- the following things have happened since we last met. When will we three meet again? And um	0
More than three of us.	0
what happened is that um, "A_",  there was some confusion between you and Jerry with the - that leading to your talking to Catherine Snow,	0
and  he  was uh he - he agreed completely that some- something confusing happened.	0
Um  his  idea was to get sort of the l- the lists of mayors of the department, the  students.  It - it's exactly how you interpreted it,	0
The list of majors in the department?	0
sort of s-	0
M- m- Majors? Majors? O_K, mayor - Something I don't know about these  O_K. O_K.	0
Ma-  majors,   majors.  "Mayors".	0
Majors.	0
The department has many mayors.	0
Majors  and um just sending the - the little write-up that we did on to those email lists uh -	0
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	0
But -	0
Yeah.	0
So it was really	0
Carol Snow who was confused, not	0
Yep, yep, yep. O_K.	0
me and not Jerry.	0
So.  So, that is uh -	0
That's good.	0
So I should still do that.	0
Yep.	0
O_K.	0
And	0
And -	0
using the	0
thing that you wrote up.	0
Yep.	0
O_K.	0
Wonderful.	0
And um we have a little description of asking peop- subjects to contact Fey for you know recruiting them for our	0
thing and um there was some confusion as to the consent form, which is basically that - that what what you just signed and since we have one already um -	0
Right.	0
Did Jerry talk to you about maybe using our class? the students in the undergrad class that he's teaching?	0
Um well he said um we - definitely "yes", however there is always  more  people in a - in a facul- uh in a department than are just taking  his  class or anybody  else's  class at the moment and one should sort of reach out and try and get them all.	0
e-	0
Yeah.	0
O_K, but th-	0
I guess it's that um people in his class cover a different set so -	0
than the c- is the CogSci department that you were talking about?	0
I  guess.  See that's what I suggested to  him,	0
uh reaching out to? Cuz we have you know people from other	0
Yeah.	0
areas	0
that people like - like Jerry and George and et cetera just -	0
advertise in their classes as well.	0
Yeah or even I could - you know I could do the actual -	0
Cuz I mean I - I know how to contact our students, so if there's something that you're sending out you can also s- um send	0
Mm-hmm.	0
That's  generally  the way it's  done.	0
Yeah.	0
me  a copy, me or Bhaskara could -  either  of us could post it to- uh is it - if it's a general solicitation that you know is just contact you then we can totally pro- post it to the news group so.	0
A mailing list.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Do it. Yeah.	0
That's -	0
O_K, so you'll send it or something  so .	0
As a matter of fact, if you - if -	0
I can send it. I'll send it, yeah.	0
You can send it to me. O_K.	0
Now, i-	0
Don't worry, we - this doesn't concern you anymore, Robert. It's fine.	0
How - however I suggest that if you - if you look at your email carefully you may think - you may find that you already have it.	0
Oops.	0
Already?	0
Really?	0
Oops.	0
Probab-	0
Maybe.	0
O_K.	0
I don't remember getting anything.	0
W- we'll see. Anyhow, um	0
the uh	0
Yeah, not only CogSci. Also we will talk about Linguistics and of course Computer Science.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um and then, secondly, we had, you may remember, um the problem with the re-phrasing, that subject always re-phrase sort of the task that uh we gave them, and so we had a meeting on Friday talking about how to avoid  that,  and it	1
Right.	0
proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for	0
how to get the - the subject m- to really  have  intentions and sort of to act upon those, and um	0
there the idea is now that next actually we - we need to hire one more person to actually  do  that job because it - it's getting more  complicated.  So if you know anyone interested in - in what i'm about to describe, tell that person to - to write a mail to me or Jerry soon, fast.	1
Um  the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks "go shopping" um "take in uh a batch of art" um	1
"visit - do some sightseeing" blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, sort of analogous to what Fey has started in - in - in compiling - compiling  here  and already - she has already gone to the trouble of - of  anchoring  it with specific um	0
o-  um entities and real world places you will find in Heidelberg.	0
And um. So out of these f- s- these high level categories the subject can pick a couple,	1
such as if - if there is a cop- uh a category in emptying your roll of film, the person can then decide	0
"O_K, I wanna do that at this place", sort of make up their own itinerary a- and - and tasks	1
and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h- high level category list with them, but	0
uh the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist's sort of schematic representation	1
with - with symbols for the objects. And so, the person can maybe make a mental note that "ah yeah I wanted to go shopping here" and "I wanted to	1
maybe take a picture of that" and "maybe um eat here"	0
and then goes in and solves the task with the system, I_E   Fey,  and um	0
and we're gonna try out that - Any questions?	0
so um y- you'll have those say somewhere what their intention was - so you still have the -	1
the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention was?	0
Mm-hmm. Yeah.	0
But they will um -	0
There's nothing that says you know	0
"these are the things you want to do" so they'll say "well these are the things I want to do" and -	0
Right, so they'll have a little bit more natural interaction?	1
O_K.	0
Hopefully.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
So they'll be given this map, which means that they won't have to like ask the system for in- for like high level information about where things are?	0
Yeah it's a schematic tourist map. So it'll be uh i- it'll still require the - that information and	0
An-	0
It w- it doesn't have like streets on it that would allow them	0
N- not - not - not really the street network.	0
to figure out their way - O_K.	0
Nuh.	0
So you're just saying like what part of town	0
Yeah a- and um the map is more a means for them to have	0
the things are in or whatever?	0
the buildings and their names and maybe some ma- ma- major streets and their names	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and we want to maybe ask them, if you have - get it sort of isolated street	0
the - the, whatever, "River Street", and they know that - they have decided that, yes, that's where they want to do this kind of action	0
um that they have it with them and they can actually read them or sort of have the label	0
for the object because it's too hard to memorize all these st- strange German names.	0
And then we're going to have another - we're gonna have w- another trial run I_E the first with that new setup tomorrow at two	1
and we have a  real  interesting subject which is Ron Kay	0
for who - those who know him, he's the founder of [MASK] So he'll - he's around seven- seventy years old, or something.	0
I didn't know he was the founder. That's -	0
O_K.	0
And he also approached me and he offered to help  um our project and he was more thinking about some high level thinking tasks and  I said "sure we need help you can come in as a subject" and he said "O_K". So that's what's gonna happen, tomorrow,	0
Using this new - new	0
data.	0
New - new set up.	0
um plan, O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
Which I'll hopefully sort of	0
scrape together t-	0
But, thanks to Fey, we already have sort of a nice blueprint and I can work with that.	0
Questions? Comments on that?	0
If not, we can move on.	0
No? No more questions?	0
So what's the s- this is what you	0
I'm not sure I totally understand this but -	0
Hmm?	0
made, Fey? Like so -	0
I'm not sure I totally understand everything that's being talked about but I - I imagine I'll c- just catch on.	0
Um are you familiar with - with the - with the very rough setup of the data?	0
So it's just based on like the materials you had about Heidelberg.	0
Based on the web site, yeah,  at the  -	0
Oh O_K there's a web site and then you could like um figure out what the cate- O_K.	0
experiment?	0
Right.	0
Uh, this is where they're supposed to -	0
It's a tourist information web site, so.	1
O_K.	0
Talk to a machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on.	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
The question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task.	1
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
Because what will happen then is that people  repeat   - repeat,	0
Hmm.	0
or as much as they can, of that phrasing.	0
Um, are you worried about being able to identify -	0
O_K.	0
Um. The - The goals that we've d- you guys have been talking about are this - these you know identifying which of three modes um their question	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh concerns. So it's like the Enter versus View -	0
Yeah, we - we - we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction, right? That's where the instructor, the person we  are  going to hire,	0
Uh-huh.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things and so	0
th- the q- first question for the subject is, "so these are things, you know, we thought a tourist can do. Is there anything that interests you?"	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And the person can say "yeah, sure sh- this is something I would do. I would go shopping".	0
Yeah? and then we can sort of - this s- instructor can say "well,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh then you - you may want to find out how to  get  over  here  because this is where the shopping district is".	0
So the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how	0
whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session?	0
No. Just sort of - O_K, what - what - what would you like to buy and then	0
Yeah.	0
um O_K there you wanna buy a whatever cuckoos clocks O_K and the- there is a store there. So the task then for that person is t- finding out how to get there, right? That's sort of what's left.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person wants to buy a cuckoos clock.	0
O_K, that's what I mean so like those tasks are all gonna be um unambiguous about which of the three	0
Hopefully.	0
modes. Right. O_K. So.	0
Well,	1
Hopefully.	0
t-	0
so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words.	1
Yes. In a sense that's exactly the - the - the idea, which is  never  possible in a - in a s- in a lab situation, nuh?	0
uh uh	0
Well, u- u- the one experiment th- that - that - that  I've  read somewhere, it was - they u- used pictures.	1
Yep.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So to - to uh actually um uh specify the - the tasks.	0
Yeah.	0
Uh, but you know i-	0
We had exactly that on our list of possible way- things so we - uh I even made a sort of a silly	0
i-	0
thing how that could work, how you control you are here you - you want to know how to get someplace, and this is the place	0
and it's a museum and you want to do some- and - and - and there's a person looking at pictures.	0
So,	0
you know, this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at pictures.	0
Right.	0
However,	1
not only was - the common census were - among all participants of Friday's meeting was	0
it's gonna be very laborious to - to make these drawings for each different things, all the different actions, if at all possible, and also people will get caught up in the pictures. So all of a sudden we'll get descriptions of pictures in there.	1
Right.	0
Right.	0
And people talking about pictures and pictorial representations and -	0
Hmm.	0
Right.	0
um	0
I would s- I would still be willing to try it.	0
I mean, I- I'm - I'm not saying it's necessary but - but uh i- uh uh i-	0
you might be able to combine you know text uh and - and some sort of picture	0
and also uh I think it - it will be a good idea to show them the text	0
and kind of  chew  the task and then take the test away - the - the - the - the - the text away so that they are not uh guided by - by	0
Mm-hmm. Yeah.	0
We will -	0
by what  you  wrote, but can come up with their - with their own -	0
Yeah, they will have no more [MASK] in front of them when they enter this room.	0
Right.	0
O_K.	0
Then I suggest we move on to the -	0
to  we have um uh [MASK] let me make one more general remark, has sort of two - two side uh um	1
actions, its um action items that we're do- dealing with,	1
one is modifying [MASK] and the other one is modifying	1
module.  And um	1
this is not too complicated but I'm just mentioning it - put it in the framework because this is	0
something we will talk about now.	0
Um, I have some news from the generation, do you have news from the parser?	0
Um,  not   -	0
By that look I -	0
Yes, uh, I would really p- It would be better if I talked about it on Friday.	0
O_K. Yeah, wonderful. Um, did you run into problems or did you run into not h- having time?	0
If that's O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
But not - not  any time part .	0
O_K, so that's good. That's better than running into problems.	0
O_K.	0
And um I - I do have some good news for [MASK] however. And the good news is I guess it's done.	1
Uh,  meaning  that Tilman Becker, who does the German one, actually took out some time and already  did  it in English for us.	1
And so the version he's sending us is already producing the English that's needed to get by in version one point one.	0
So I take it that was similar to the - what - what we did for the parsing?	0
Yeah. I - I - it - even though the generator is a little bit more complex and it would have been, not changing one hundred words but maybe four hundred words, but it would have been	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
@@	0
but this - this is I guess good news, and the uh - the time	0
and especially Bhaskara and uh - and um -	0
Oh do I have it here?	0
No. The time is now pretty much fixed. It's the last week of April until the fourth of May so it's twenty-sixth through fourth.	1
That they'll be here?	0
That they'll be here. So it's - it's extremely important that the two of you are also present in this town	0
during that time.	0
Wait, what - what are the days?	0
April twenty-sixth to the - May fourth?	0
Yeah, something like that.	0
I'll  probably be here.	0
Yeah.	0
It's -	0
You will be here.	0
There is a d- Isn't finals coming up then pretty much after that?	0
Finals  was that.	0
Yeah w- it doesn't really have much meaning to grad students but  final   projects  might.	0
Yeah actually, that's true.	0
O_K.	0
That -	0
Anyway, so this is -	0
Well I'll be here working on something.	0
Guaranteed, it's just uh will I be  here,  you know, in uh - I'll be here  too  actually but -	0
Hmm.	0
No it's just um you know they're coming for us so that we can bug them and ask them more questions and sit down together and write sensible code and they can give some nice talks and stuff. But uh	1
Ye-	0
just make a -	0
But it's not like we need to be with them twenty-four hours a day s- for the seven days that they're here.	0
Not -	0
not unless you really really want to.	0
They're very dependent	0
Not unless you really want to.	0
And they're both nice guys so you may - may want to.	0
O_K, that much from the parser and generator side, unless there are more questions on that.	0
So, no [MASK] yet?	0
No.	0
O_K.	0
It - Just a mail that, you know, he's sending me the - the - the stuff soon and I was completely flabbergasted here and I - and that's also it's - it's going to produce [MASK] uh blah-blah-blah information for - necessary for one point one in English - based on the English, you know, in English. So.	0
This is being sent, mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I was like "O_K,	0
We're  done.	0
we're done!"	0
So that was like one of the first l- You know, the first task was getting it working for English. So that's basically	0
over now. Is that right?	0
Yeah.	0
So the basic requirement fulfilled.	0
Um, the basic requirement is fulfilled	1
almost. When	1
Andreas Stolcke and - and his gang, when they have um changed [MASK] then we can actually a- put it all together	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm. So [MASK] also works. Uh-huh.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and	0
you  can speak into it and ask for T_V and  movie  information and then when if -  if  something actually happens and some answers come out, then we're done.	1
Toll.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
If - and they're kind of correct.  And they kind of are - are correct. It's not just like anything.	0
So it's  not  done basically.	0
Hmm?	0
Right.	0
Perhaps if the answers have something to do with the questions for example.	0
And they're mostly in English. So.	0
Then um -	0
Are they - is it using the database? the German T_V movie. O_K. So  all the actual data might be German names?	0
Yeah.	0
Um well actually th- um	0
Or are they all like American T_V programs?	0
um well -	0
I want to see	0
"Die Dukes Von Hazard"  @@	0
The -	0
O_K, so you don't know how the German dialogue - uh the German - the demo dialogue actually works. It works - the first thing is what's, you know, showing on T_V,	0
and then the person is presented with what's running on T_V in Germany on that day, on that evening	0
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.	0
and so you take one look at it and then you say "well that's really nothing - there's nothing for me there"	0
"what's running in the cinemas?" So maybe there's something better happening there. And then you get - you're shown what movies play which films, and it's gonna be of course all the Heidelberg movies and	0
Mm-hmm.	0
what  films  they are actually showing. And most of them are going to be Hollywood movies.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Hmm.	0
So, "American Beauty" is "American Beauty", right?  Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
And um.	0
But they're shown like on a screen. It's a - I mean so would the generator, like the English language sentence of it is - "these are the follow- you know the following films are being shown" or something like that?	0
N-	0
Yeah, but it in that sense it doesn't make - In that case uh it doesn't really make sense to read them out loud.	0
S-	0
Right. So it'll just display - O_K. So we don't have to worry about um -	0
if you're displaying them.	0
But uh it'll tell you that this is what's showing in Heidelberg	0
Yeah.	0
and there you go. And the presentation agent will go "Hhh!"    Nuh?	0
O_K.	0
Like that - the avatar. And um.	0
O_K.	0
And then you pick - pick a movie and - and - and it show- shows you the times and you pick a time and you pick seats and all of this. So.	0
O_K.	0
Pretty straightforward.	0
O_K.	0
But it's - so this time we -  we  are at an advantage because it was a  problem  for the  German  system to incorporate all these English  movie  titles.	0
Yeah.	0
Nuh?	0
Right.	0
But in English, that's not really a problem,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
unless we get some - some topical  German  movies that have  just  come out and that are in their database.	0
Right.	0
So the person may select   "Huehner Rennen"   or whatever.	0
"Chicken Run".	0
O_K. Then uh on to the modeling.	1
Right?	0
Yeah, yeah, I guess.	0
Um then modeling,	0
there it is.	0
O_K. What's the  next  thing?	0
Yep. e-	0
This is very rough but this is sort of what um Johno and I managed to come up with.	0
The idea here is that -	0
This is the uh s-	0
the schema of the X_M_L here, not	0
an example or something like that.	0
Yeah this is not an X_M_L this is sort of towards an -  a schema , nuh?  definition.	0
O_K.	0
Right.	0
The idea is, so, imagine we have a library of	1
schema such as [MASK]	1
and then we have forced uh motion,	1
we have [MASK]	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
we have a whole library of schemas.	0
And they're gonna be, you know, fleshed out in - in their real ugly detail, [MASK] and there's gonna be s- a lot of stuff on the Goal and blah-blah-blah, that a goal can be and so forth.	1
What we think is -	0
And all the names could - should be taken   "cum grano salis".   So. This is a -	0
the fact that we're calling [MASK] right now should not entail that we are going to  continue  calling	0
we have here first of all on the - in the - in the first iteration a stupid list of [MASK]	0
Actions that can be categorized with - or that are related to [MASK]	0
wi-	0
O_K.	0
to that schema	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and we will have you know [MASK]	0
And then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary.	1
So a push may be in - in - in both you know push uh in this or this uh -	0
[MASK] for instance, O_K.	0
Exactly. Yeah.  Also,  these things may or may not	0
get their own structure in the future.	0
So  this  is something that, you know,  may  also be a res- As a result of  your  work in the future, we may find out that, you know, there're really s- these subtle differences between um  even   within  the domain of entering in the light of [MASK] that we need to put in - fill in additional structure up there.	0
But it gives us a nice handle. So with this we can basically um you know s- slaughter the cow any- anyway we want.	0
Uh.	0
It - it is -	0
It was sort of a - it gave us some headache, how do we avoid writing down that we have sort of [MASK] that this -	0
But this sort of gets the job done in that respect and maybe it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in  a   sense that	0
um we're talking about two different things. We're talking more on the sort of  intention  level, up  there,   and more on the - this is the - your basic bone um schema, down there.	1
Uh one question, Robert. When you point at the screen is it your  shadow  that I'm supposed to look at? O_K. Whereas I  keep   looking where your hand is,	0
Yeah. It's the shadow.	0
and it doesn't -	0
Well,  that  wouldn't have helped you at  all.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
Basically, what this is - is that there's an interface between what we are doing and the action planner	1
Spit right here.	0
and right now the way the interface is	1
"action go" and then they have the -	0
what the person claimed was the source and the person claimed as the goal	0
passed on.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And the problem is, is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type "going into", goes of type "want to go to a place where I can take a picture of", et cetera.	1
So this is sort of what it looks like now, some simple "Go" action from it - from an object named "Peter's Kirche" of the type "Church" to an object named "Powder-Tower" of the type "Tower".	0
This is the uh - what the action planner uses? This is - O_K.	0
Right?	0
Right.  Currently.	0
And is that - and tha- that's changeable? or not?	0
Currently.	0
Yeah, well -	0
Like are we adapting to it?	0
Or -	0
No. We - This is the output, sort of, of [MASK] right?	0
Oh, yeah.	0
Uh-huh.	0
the input into [MASK] as it is now.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And what  we  are going to do, we going to - and you can see here, and again for Johno please - please focus the  shadow,	0
O_K.	0
um we're gon- uh uh	0
here you have the action	0
and the domain object and w- and on - on -	0
What did you think he was doing?	0
O_K, sorry.	0
I just -	0
A laser pointer would be most appropriate here I think.	0
Eee.	0
Yeah I - I um have - I have no -	0
Robert likes to be abstract and that's what I just thought he was doing.	0
You look up  here.   O_K.	0
Sort of between here and here, so as you can see this is on one level and we are going to add another	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um "Struct", if you want,	0
I_E a rich action description on that level.	0
So it's just an additional information -	0
So in the future -	0
Exactly. In the future though, the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an - an action and a domain object but an action, a domain object, and a rich action description,	1
Right? that doesn't hurt the current way.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
which is -	0
Which - which we're abbreviating as [MASK]	0
Good.	0
Hmm.	0
Rad!	0
So um you had like an action schema and [MASK] right? So how d	0
Hmm.	0
Hmm. Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah can you go back to that one?	0
So [MASK] in this case,	0
I've - if I understand how we described - we set this up,	0
um cuz we've been arguing about it all week,	0
but uh we'll hold the - the -	0
Well in this case it will hold the -	0
I mean the -	0
the  features  I guess. I'm not - it's hard for me to exactly s-	0
So basically that will store	0
the - the object that is w-	0
the  Source  will store the object that we're going from, the  Goal  will store the -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So the fillers of the role source.	0
the f- we'll fill those in fill those roles in, right?	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
[MASK] basically have extra -	0
See we - so those are - schemas exist because in case we need extra information	0
instead of just making it an attribute and which - which is just one thing we - we decided to make it's own entity so that we could	1
explode it out later on	0
in case there is some structure that - that we need to exploit.	1
O_K, so th- sorry I just don't kn- um um um - This is just	0
uh X_M_L mo- notational but um the fact that it's [MASK] and then sort	0
That's a block, yeah.	0
whereas source is just an attribute? Is that -	0
No, no, no. Source is just not spelled out here. Source meaning - Source will be uh will have a name, a type,	0
Oh, O_K, O_K.	0
maybe [MASK] mayb	0
Uh-huh, uh-huh.	0
uh orientation -	0
O_K could it - it could also be blocked out then as - O_K.	0
Yeah, the - So - Yeah.	0
s- Source it will be, you know we'll f- we know a lot about sources so we'll put all of that in Source. But it's independent whether we are using [MASK]	0
O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
We can talk about Paths being the fastest, the quickest, the nicest and so forth, uh or - or - and [MASK] should be coming in there as well.	0
O_K.	0
And then G- the same about Goals.	0
O_K. So I guess the question is when you actually fill one of these out, it'll be under [MASK] Those are -	0
It's gonna be one - y- you'll pick one of those for - O_K these are - this is just a layout of the  possible  that could go - play that role. O_K, go it. Uh-huh.	0
Right.	0
Right, so the - the - the roles will be filled in with the schema and then what actual a-	1
Hmm?	0
O_K.	0
action is	0
O_K.	0
chosen is - will be in the - in [MASK]	1
S- S-	0
O_K, so one question. This was - in this case it's all um clear, sort of obvious,	0
but you can think of [MASK] as each having their roles, right? the -	0
I mean it's - it's implicit that the person that's moving is doing entering viewing and approaching,	0
but you know the usual thing is we have bindings between sort of - they're sort of like action specific roles and the more general [MASK]	0
So are we worrying about that or not for now? O_K.	0
Yes, yes. Since you bring it up now, we will worry about it. Tell us more about it.	0
O_K.	0
What's that? Oh I guess it -	0
What do you - what do you -	0
I - I may be just um reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that I've always viewed things	0
Hmm.	0
Hmm.	0
and  that - that may or may not be what you guys intended.	0
But if it  is,  then the top block is sort of like	1
um, you know, you have to list exactly what [MASK]	0
that has its own s- structure and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching,	1
but those could include roles like the thing that you're viewing, the thing that you're entering, the thing that you're whatever, you know,	0
So very specific role names are "viewed thing", "entered thing" -	0
that - which are - think - think of enter, view and approach as frames and they have frame-specific parameters and - and roles	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
and you can also describe them in a general way as [MASK] and maybe there'	1
Mm-hmm.	0
how do they work in terms of you know [MASK] or how do they work in f- terms of other things. So all of those have um	1
Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.	0
basically f- either specific - frame specific roles or more general	0
frame specific roles that might have binding. So the question is are um - how to represent when things are linked in a certain way.	1
So we know for Enter that there's Container potentially involved and it's not -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh I don't know if you wanna have in the same level as [MASK] it - it's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container and the interior of it corresponds to some part of [MASK]	1
um you know goal - uh goal I guess in this case. So uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there's  identity  basically between things and I di- don't know if that's something we need to invent or you know just -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
The - wa- wasn't there supposed to be a link in the	0
Right.	0
I don't know if this answers your question, I was just staring at this while you were talking, sorry.	0
It's O_K.	0
Uh a link between [MASK]	0
a field in the s- in the	0
schema for [MASK] that would link us t	0
Yeah.	0
Um, well that's - that's one - one thing is that	0
we can link up,	0
think also that um	0
we can have one or m- as many as we want links from - from the schema up to the s- action um description of it.	0
Hmm.	0
But the notion I got from Nancy's idea was	0
that we may f- find sort of	0
concepts floating around i- in the a- action description of the action f- "Enter" frame up there that are,	0
e- when you talk about the  real  world, actually identical to the goal of the -	0
Exactly.	0
[MASK] and	0
Right, right.	0
do we have means of - of telling it within that a- and the answer is absolutely.	1
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
The way - we absolutely have those means that are even part of [MASK]	0
Oh great. s- Uh-huh.	0
meaning we can reference. So meaning -	1
Great. That's exactly what is necessary.	0
And um. This referencing thing however is of  temporary  nature because sooner or later [MASK] will be	0
Yeah.	0
St-	0
finished with [MASK] uh,	0
um,	0
specification and then it's going to be even  much  nicer. Then we have  real  means of  pointing  at an  individual   instantiation   of one of our elements here and link it to another one, and this not only  within  a document but also  via  documents,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
and - and all in [MASK]	0
So you know - happen to know how - what - what "sooner or later" means like in practice?	0
That's  @@  but it's soon. So it's g- it's - the spec is there and it's gonna part of [MASK] filed by the end of this year so that this means we can start using it basically now. But this is a technical detail.	0
Or estimated. O_K, O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So a pointer - a way to really say pointers.	0
Basically references from the roles in the schema - the bottom schemas to [MASK] is wha- uh I'm assuming.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, I mean  personally,  I'm looking even  more  forward	1
O_K.	0
to the day when we're going to have  [MASK] which l- is a form of notation where it allows you to say	0
that if [MASK] up there is  Enter,	0
Uh-huh.	0
then the  goal  type can never be a statue.	1
Right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So you have constraints that are dependent on the c- actual s- specific filler, uh,	0
Mm-hmm, yeah.	0
W-	0
Yeah e- exactly. Um,	0
of some attribute. Uh-huh.	0
you know  this,  of course, does not make sense in light of the Statue of  Liberty,	0
Right.	0
however  it is uh you know sort of - these sort of things are imaginable.	0
Tsk.  Hhh.   Yeah.	0
Or the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. So.	0
Yeah?	0
S-	1
Yeah.	0
So um,	0
like are you gonna have similar schemas for [MASK] lik	1
Yeah.	1
And if so like can - are you able to enforce that you know if - if it's - if it's [MASK] then you have that schema, if it'	0
present in the -	0
Um we have absolute - No. We have absolutely no means of enforcing that,	0
so it would be considered valid if we have [MASK] and n	1
Could  happen.	0
Whi- which is not  bad,  because I mean, that there's multiple sens- I mean that particular case, there's mult- there - there's a forced side of -	0
of that verb as well.	0
Hmm. It - maybe it means we had nothing to  say  about [MASK]	0
O_K.	0
What's  also  nice, and for a- i- for me in my mind it's - it's crucially necessary, is that we can have multiple schemas and multiple action schemas in parallel.	1
Right.	0
And um we started thinking about going through our  bakery  questions, so when I say "is there a bakery here?"	0
you know I  do   ultimately  want our module to be able to first of all f- tell the rest of the system "hey this person actually wants to  go  there" and "B_",  that person actually wants to buy something to eat there. Nuh? And if these are two different schemas, I_E [MASK] of getting there and then the buying snacks schema, nuh? -	0
Would they both be listed here in - O_K. Under so o- under [MASK] there's a list that can include both -	0
Yes.	0
ye- Yeah, they they would -  both  schemas would appear, so what is the uh is - is there a "buying s- snacks" schema? What is the uh -	0
Right.	0
both  things.	0
Snack action.	0
That's interesting.	0
What?	0
have the buying snack schema?	0
See.	0
Buying -	0
I'm sure there's a commercial event schema in there somewhere.	0
Oop.	0
buying  his  food -	0
I-	0
Yeah, a "commercial event" or something. Yeah? So uh -	0
d- f-	0
Yeah I - I -	0
so we would - we would instantiate [MASK] with [MASK] blah-blah-blah and the buying event	0
I see.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Uh-huh.	0
you know at which - however that looks like,	0
the place f-	0
Interesting. Would you say that the - like -	0
thing to buy.	0
I mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things,	1
but there's also this sort of like causal, well, so one is really facilitating the other and it's part of a compound action of some kind, which has structure.	1
Yeah.	0
Now it's  technically  possible that you can fit schema within schema,	0
uh I - I think that's  nicer  for a lot of reasons but might be a pain so uh -	0
and schema within schemata -	0
um	0
Well, for me it seems that uh -	0
r-	0
I mean there are truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express at once, but in  this  case it's really like	0
Yes.	0
there's a purpo- means that you know f- for achieving some other purpose.	0
Well, if I'm - if I'm recipient of such a message and I get [MASK] where the goal is a bakery and then I get a commercial action which takes place in a bakery, right?	0
Uh-huh.	0
and - and - and they - they are obviously, via identifiers, identified to be the same thing here.	0
Yeah. See that - that bothers me that they're the same thing.	0
No, no, just the - Yeah?	0
Yeah because they're two different things one of which is l- you could think of one a sub you know pru- whatever pre-condition for the second.	0
Yeah, yeah!	0
Right. Yeah, yeah. So. So. O_K.	0
So there's like  levels  of granularity. So uh there's - there's um a  single  event of which they are	1
both a part. And they're -  independently  they - they are events which have	0
very different characters as far as [MASK] whatever. So when you identify [MASK] and	0
Mm-hmm, yeah.	0
whatever, there's gonna to be a desire, whatever, eating, hunger, whatever other frames you have involved,	0
they have to match up in - in nice ways. So it seems like each of them has its own  internal  structure and mapping to these	0
Mm-hmm.	0
schemas you know from the other -	0
But you know that's just -	0
That's just me.	0
Like -  I - I -	0
Well,	1
I think we're gonna	0
hit a lot of interesting	0
problems and as I prefaced it	1
this is the result of one week of arguing	0
Mm-hmm.	0
about it	0
Between you guys uh  O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
and um -	0
and so -	0
Yeah I mean I - I still am not entirely sure that I really fully grasp the syntax of this. You know, like what -	0
Well it's not - it's not actually a very - actually, it doesn't actually -	0
Um	0
it occur - it occurs to me that I mean ne-	0
Right.	0
Or the intended interpretation of this. Yeah.	0
um well I should have - we should have added an ano- an X_M_L example,	1
or some X_M_L examples	0
Yeah.	0
yeah that would be - that would be nice.	0
and - and this is on - on a - on - on my list of things until next - next week.	1
O_K.	0
It's also a question of the recursiveness and - and a hier- hierarchy	0
Yeah. Yeah.	0
um in there. Do we want the schemas just blump blump blump blump?	1
I mean it's - if we can actually you know get it so that we can, out of  one  utterance, activate  more  than one  schema,  I mean, then we're already pretty good, right?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Well - well you have to be careful with that uh uh thing because uh	1
I mean many actions presuppose some - um almost  infinitely many  other  actions. So if you go to a bakery  you have a general intention of uh	1
Yeah.	0
Mayb- yeah.	0
not being hungry.	0
You have a specific intentions to cross the traffic light to get there. You have a further specific intentions to left - to lift your right foot and so uh uh I mean y- you really have to focus on	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Hmm?	0
Right.	0
on - on and  decide  the level of - of abstraction that - that you aim at it kind of zero in on that, and more or less ignore the rest, unless there is some implications	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
that - that you want to  constant draw  from -	0
from sub-tasks um that are  relevant	0
M-	0
Th-	0
uh I mean but  very  difficult.	0
The other thing that I just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you're supposed to meet your friend there or som- you know so	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
you - like being able to  infer  the second thing is very useful and probably often right. But having them separate -	0
Well the - the - the utterance was "is there a bakery around here?", not	0
Well maybe their friend said they were going to meet them in a bakery around the area.	0
"I want to go to a bakery."	0
Right.	0
And I'm, yeah - I'm - I'm inventing contexts which are maybe unlikely, but yeah I mean like - but it's still the case that um you could - you could override that default by giving extra information which is to me a reason why you would keep	0
Right.	0
Sure it - O_K. Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm, yeah.	0
the inference of that separate from the knowledge of "O_K they really want to know if there's a bakery around here", which is direct.	0
Yeah.	0
Well there - there - there should never be a hard coded uh  shortcut from  the bakery question to the	0
uh double schema	0
Right.	0
thing, how uh - And, as a matter of fact, when I have traveled with my friends we make these - exactly these kinds of appointments.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.  Exactly.  It's - I met someone at the bakery you know in the Victoria Station t- you know  train station London before, yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
We o- o-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
Yep.	0
Well.	0
I have a question about [MASK] S	0
It's like  -	0
will have a choice.	0
Or - or - or - or will it just	0
um uh - is it change -	0
[MASK] either is an Enter or a View or an Approach, right? O_K.	0
Right, right. So - so I - I mean for -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
for each particular action that you may want to characterize	0
you would have	0
some number of slots that define uh uh uh	0
you know in  some  way what this action is all about. It can be either A_, B_ or C_. Um.	0
So is it a fixed number or - or do you leave it open - it could be between one and fifteen uh - it's - it's - it's flexible.	0
Um, the uh -	0
Well, it sort of depends on - on if you actually write down the - the schema then you have to say it's either one of them	0
or it can be none, or it can be any of them. However the uh - it seems to be	0
sensible to me to r- to view them as mutually exclusive	0
um	0
maybe even  not.	0
J-	0
Do you mean within [MASK] Those three?	0
uh	0
Yeah.	0
ye- uh uh b- I- uh I - u- I understand uh but -	0
And um how - how where is the end? So that's -	0
No, no. There - a- a- actually by I think my question is simpler than that, um	0
is - O_K, so you have [MASK] and - and it has three different um uh aspects um	0
because you can either enter a building or view it or - or approach it and touch it or something.	0
Um now you define uh  another  action, it's - it's called um	0
[MASK]	0
uh s- [MASK] that has to do with writing a letter, let's say. I mean not even within this context, but	0
Yeah.	0
a different action. Um and this - uh action-two would have various variable possibilities of interpreting what you would like to do.	0
And - i- in - in a way similar to either [MASK] you may want to send a letter, read a letter, or dictate a letter, let's say.	0
Oh the - O_K  uh maybe I'd -	0
So, h-	0
The uh -	0
These actions - I don't know if I'm gonna answer your question or not with this, but	0
the categories inside of [MASK] so, [MASK] is a  category.	0
Real- although I think what we're specifying here is this is a category where the	0
actions "enter, view and approach" would fall into because they have a related [MASK] in our tourist domain.	0
Cuz viewing in a tourist domain is going up to it and - or actually going from one place to another to take a picture, in this - in a -	0
Right.	0
Oh, s- so it's sort of automatic derived fr- from the structure that - that is built elsewhere.	0
derived  I don't know if I u-	0
This is a cate- this a category structure here, right? [MASK]	1
Right.	0
What are some types of [MASK] Well one of the types	1
And what are some types of  that?  And an Enter,	1
Right.	0
Hmm.	1
a View, an Approach. Those are all [MASK]	1
Inside of Enter there will be roles that can be filled	1
basically. So if I want to go from outside to inside	1
then you'd have the roles that need to filled, where you'd have [MASK]	0
set of roles. So you'd the Source would be outside and Path is to the door or whatever, right?	1
Right.	0
So if you wanted to have a new type of action you'd create a new type of category.	1
Then this category would - we would put it - or not necessarily - We would put	0
a new action in the m- uh in the categories that -	0
in which it has the um - Well, every action has a set of related schemas	0
like [MASK] or force, whatever, right?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
So we would put "write a letter" in the categories uh that - in which it had - it w- had uh	0
There could be a communication event action or something like that and you could write it.	0
schemas u-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Exactly. Schemas uh that of that type.	0
And then later,	0
you know, there - the -	0
we have [MASK] where we'd define it down there as -	0
Hmm.	0
So there's a bit a redundancy, right? in - in which the things that go into a particular - You have categories at the top under [MASK] and the things that go under a particular category are um	1
supposed to have a corresponding schema definition for that type. So I guess what's the function of having it up there too?	0
I mean I guess I'm wondering whether - You  could  just have under [MASK] you could just sort of say whatever you know it's gonna be Enter, View or Approach or whatever number of things and pos- partly because	0
Mm-hmm.	0
you  need  to know somewhere that those things fall into some categories. And it  may  be multiple categories as you say which is um the reason why it gets a little messy um but if it has -	0
Yeah.	0
if it's supposed to be categorized in category X_ then the corresponding schema X_ will be among the structures that - that follow. That's like -	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
Well, this is one of things we were arguing about.	0
th- this is - this r- this is - this is more - this is probably the way that	0
O_K, sorry.  You didn't tell me to -	0
th- that's the way that seemed more intuitive to Johno I guess also for a while - for  No, no, no. Uh we have  not  - we have not seen the light.	0
Uh-huh.	0
But now you guys have seen the light. So.	0
No.	0
I- it's easy to go back and forth isn't it?  Uh-huh.	0
The - the reason -	0
One reason we're doing it this way is in case there's extra structure that's in the Enter action that's not captured by the schemas, right?	0
I agree. Right. Right.	0
Which is why I would think you would say Enter and then just say all the things that are relevant  specifically  to Enter. And then the things that are  abstract  will be in the abstract things as well. And that's why the bindings become useful.	1
Right, but -	0
Ri-   You'd  like - so you're saying you could practically turn this structure inside  out?  or something, or - ?	0
Um	0
No basically w-	0
Ye- I see what you mean by that, but I - I don't if I would - I would need to have t- have that.	0
Get - get rid of [MASK]	0
Right.	0
uh or [MASK] because what does that tell us?	0
Uh-huh.	0
Yeah.	0
Um and I  agree  that you know this is something we need to discuss, yeah.	1
I- in fact what you could say is for  Enter,	0
you could say "here, list all the kinds of schemas that -	0
on the category that -	0
List all the  parent  categories.	0
you know i- list all the parent categories". It's just like	1
[MASK] right? like you hav	1
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
frames are such-and-such, h- and then those are the ones that actually you then actually define and say how the roles bind to your  specific  roles which will probably be f- richer and fuller and have other stuff in there.	0
Yeah.	0
This sounds like a  paper  I've read around here recently in terms of -	0
Yeah it could  be not a coincidence.	0
Like I said, I'm sure I'm just hitting everything with a hammer that I developed, but I mean you know uh it's -	0
Yeah.	0
I'm just telling you what I think, you just hit the button and it's like -	0
And , I guess fr- uh	0
Yeah I mean but there's a good question here. Like, I mean uh do you - When do you need -	0
Hhh.   Damn  this headset!	0
When you this uh, eh -	0
Metacomment.	0
Yeah.	0
That's all recorded.	0
Um.	0
"Damn this project."  No just kidding.	0
Why do you -	0
Hhh.  I don't know. Like -	0
