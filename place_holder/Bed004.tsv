And then if - Would you do me a big favor, um, maybe Robert, cuz you know how to do this,  that's just  hitting the square? the black square when you're done?	0

O_K.	0
Now,  I signed us up for the Wednesday slot,	1
and part of what we should do is this. So,	1
my idea on that was	1
uh, partly we'll talk about system stuff for the  computer  scientists, but partly I did want it to get the  linguists  involved	1
in some of this issue about what the  task  is and	1
all - um you know, what the  dialogue  is, and what's going on  linguistically,	1
because to the extent that we can get  them   contributing,	1
that will be good.	1
Yep.	0
So this issue about	0
you know re-formulating things, maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they'll  help  us with it,	0
uh,  other  linguists, if you're a linguist, but in any case, um,	0
Yep.	0
the linguistics students and stuff.	0
So my idea on - on Wednesday is  partly	0
to uh - you - I mean, what you did today would - i- is just  fine.  You just uh do "this is what we did, and here's the  thing, and here's s- some of the dialogue and - and	1
so forth."	1
But then, the  other  thing of course is we should	0
um give the  computer  scientists some idea of - of	0
what's going on with the  system  design, and where we think the  belief-nets  fit in and where the  pieces  are and stuff like that.	0
Yep.	0
Is - is this  make sense to everybody? Yeah.	0
So, I don't - I don't think it's worth	0
a lot of work, particularly on  your  part, to - to - to make a big presentation. I don't think you should -	0
you don't have to make  any  new  uh PowerPoint or anything. I think we got  plenty  of stuff	0
to talk about.	0
And, then um	0
just see how a discussion goes.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Sounds good. The uh	0
other two things is um	0
we've -	0
can have Johno tell us a little about this	0
Great.	0
and we also have a l- little bit on the interface, M_-three-L_ enhancement, and then um that was  it,  I think.	0
So, what I did for this - this is - uh, a pedagogical belief-net because	1
I was - I - I took - I tried to	0
conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out - so what I did was I took - I made these dummy nodes called Trajector-In and Trajector-Out that	0
Yep.	0
would isolate the things related to the trajector. And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal.	0
Yep.	0
And I separated them out. And then I um did similar things for our - our net to - uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot,	0
um, so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the - the  top  layer.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And then the bottom layer is just the Mode.	0
So, let's - let's - Yeah, I don't understand it. Let's go -	0
So.	0
Slide all the way up so we see what the p- the p-	0
very  bottom  looks like, or is  that  it?	0
Yeah, there's just one more node and it says "Mode" which is the decision between the -	0
Yeah.	0
O_K, great. Alright. So -	0
So basically all I did was I took the last  belief-net	1
Mm-hmm.	0
and I grouped things according to what - how I thought they would fit in to	1
uh  image  schemas that would be related. And the two that I came up with	1
Yep.	0
were Trajector-landmark and then Source-path-goal as initial ones.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And then I said well, uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably.	1
Right, yep.	0
Um,	1
you know, we have - we have the concept of what their intention was, whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever,	1
Right.	0
or they were hurried.  That's  kind of related to  that.  And then um	1
in terms of the source, the things - uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether -	0
Oh actually, I kind of, - I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one but	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh whether the - where I'm  currently  at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether -	0
or the "landmark-iness" of where I'm  currently  at. And "usefulness" is basi- basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that's not -	0
something that you'd visit for tourist's - tourism's sake or whatever.	0
"Travel constraints" would be something like	0
you know, maybe they said they can - they only wanna take a  bus  or something like that, right?	0
And then those are somewhat related to the path, so that would	0
Mm-hmm.	0
determine whether we'd - could take - we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly.	0
Um, "Goal".	0
Similar things as the  source  except they also added whether the entity was closed and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination.	0
Um,	0
and then if you go up,	0
Robert,	0
Yeah, so -	1
um,	1
in terms of Context, what we had currently said was	1
whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other	1
person.	1
Um, Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee, or something along those lines.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh, Prosody I don't really - I'm not really sure what prosody means, in this context,	1
so I just made up you know whether - whether what they say is - or h-  how  they say it	0
Right, O_K.	0
is - is  that.	0
Um, the Parse would be what verb they chose, and then maybe how they modified it, in the sense of	1
whether they said "I need to get there quickly" or whatever.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And um, in terms of World Knowledge, this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things, the time of day it is, and whatnot.	1
What's "tourbook"?	0
Tourbook? That would be, I don't know, the "landmark-iness" of things,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
whether it's in the  tourbook  or not.	0
Ch-ch-ch-ch.	0
Now.    Alright, so I understand what's -	0
what you  got.	0
I don't yet understand  how you would  use  it. So let me see if I can ask	0
a s-	0
Well, this is not a working Bayes-net.	1
Right.	0
No, I  understand  that, but - but um	0
So,	0
what -	0
Let's slide back up again and see - start at the - at the  bottom  and	0
Oop-bo-doop-boop-boop.  Yeah.	0
So,	0
you could  imagine	0
w-	0
Uh,	0
go ahead, you were about to go up there and  point  to something.	0
Well I - O_K, I just - Say what you were gonna say. O_K.	0
Good, do it! No no, go do it.	0
Uh - I - I'd -	0
No, I was gonna wait until -	0
Oh,  O_K . So, so if you - if we made - if we wanted to make it into a - a real uh Bayes-net,	0
that is, you know, with fill - you know, actually f- uh, fill it  @@  in, then uh -	0
So we'd have to get rid of  this	0
and connect these things directly to the Mode.	0
Well, I don't - That's an issue. So, um -	0
Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise.	0
Well, here's the problem.	0
And - and uh - Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today - is, if we just  do  this, we could wind up with a  huge	1
uh,	1
combinatoric input to the  Mode  thing.	1
And uh -	0
Well I - oh yeah, I unders- I understand  that,  I just - uh it's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that.	1
Well, i- But  that's  what we have to  do.	0
O_K.	0
O_K, so, so,	0
uh.	0
There - there are a variety of ways of doing it.	0
Uh. Let me just mention something that I  don't  want to pursue today which is	1
there are  technical  ways of doing it, uh I- I slipped a paper to Bhaskara	1
and - about Noisy-OR's and Noisy-MAXes and	1
there're ways to	0
uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes-net-edness.	0
Mmm.	0
Uh,	0
so. If you co- you could ima- and I- now I don't	0
know  that any of those actually  apply  in this case, but there is some technology you could try to apply.	0
So it's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that -	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
And, um	0
So.	0
So in  that  case, the sum- we'd have - we - I mean, these wouldn't be the  summary  nodes. We'd have the summary nodes like where the things were - I guess maybe if thi- if things were related to business or	0
Yeah.	0
some other -	0
So what I was gonna  say  is - is maybe a good at this point	0
Yeah.	0
is to	0
try to  informally  - I mean, not necessarily in th- in this  meeting,	1
but to try to  informally  think about what the decision variables  are.	1
So, if you have some bottom line	0
uh decision about which  mode,	1
you know,  what  are the most relevant  things.	1
Mmm.	0
And the  other  trick, which is not a  technical  trick, it's kind of a  knowledge  engineering trick,	1
is to make the n-  each node sufficiently narrow	1
that you don't get this combinatorics. So	1
that if you decided	0
that you could characterize the decision as a trade-off between three factors, whatever they may be,	0
O_K? then you could say "Aha, let's have  these   three  factors",	0
O_K? and maybe a binary version f- for each, or	0
some relatively compact	0
decision node just  above  the final one.	1
Mmm.	0
And  then  the question would be if - if  those  are the things that you  care  about,	1
uh can you make a  relatively  compact way of getting	1
from the various  inputs  to the things you  care  about.	1
So that y-	0
so that, you know, you can sort of try to do a  knowledge  engineering thing	0
O_K.	0
given  that we're not gonna screw with the	0
technology  and just always use	0
uh sort of orthodox  Bayes-nets,  then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of	0
how do we  do  that.	0
Um	0
and	0
So what I kind of need to do is to take  this  one and the  old  one and merge them together? So that -	0
"Eh-eh-eh."	0
Yeah.	0
Well,	0
mmm,	0
something.  I mean, so	0
uh,  Robert  has thought about this problem f- for a long time, cuz he's had these examples	0
kicking around, so he may have some good intuition	0
about	0
you know, what  are  the crucial things.	0
Mmm.	0
and,	0
um,	0
I understand where this - the uh -	0
this is a way of	0
playing with this abs- Source-path-goal trajector exp- uh uh abstraction and - and sort of sh- displaying it in a particular way.	0
Yeah.	0
Uh,	0
I don't think our friends	0
uh on Wednesday are going to be able to -	0
Well,  maybe  they will. Well, let me think about whether - whether I think we can present this to them or  not.	0
Um,	0
Uh,	0
Well, I think this is still, I mean,	0
ad-hoc. This is sort of th- the second	0
version and I - I - I - look at this maybe just as a,	0
you know, a - a - whatever, U_M_L diagram or, you know, as just a uh screen shot,	0
not really as a Bayes-net as John - Johno said.	0
We could actually, y- yeah draw it in a different way,	0
in the sense that it would make it more abstract.	0
Yeah.	0
But the uh -	1
the - the nice thing is that you know, it just	1
is a - is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple-	1
clearly have to be specified m- more carefully and uh	1
Alright, well, le- let me think about this some more,	1
and uh see if we can	1
find a way to	1
present this	1
to this  linguists  group that - that is  helpful  to  them.	1
I mean,	0
ultimately we - we may w- w-	0
we regard this as sort of an exercise in -	0
in thinking about the problem	0
and maybe a first version of uh	0
a  module,  if you wanna call it that, that you can ask,	0
that you can give input and it- it'll uh throw the dice for you,	0
uh throw the die for you,  because um	1
I integrated this into the  existing  SmartKom system in - in the same way as	1
much the same way we can um	1
sort of have this uh -	1
this  thing.	1
Close this down.	0
So if this is what M_-three-L_ um	0
will  look  like and what it'll  give  us,	0
um - And a very simple thing. We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere, which is some type of object, to someplace.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And this - these uh - this changed now  only  um,	0
um -	0
It's doing it twice now because it already did it once.	0
Um, we'll add some action type, which in this case is "Approach"	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Good.	0
and could be, you know, more refined uh	0
in many ways. Or we can uh	0
have something where the uh	0
goal is a public place	0
and it will give us then of course an action type of the type "Enter".	0
So this is just based on this one -	0
um,	0
on this one feature,	0
and that's - that's about all you can do.	0
And so in the f- if this pla- if the object type	0
um here is - is a m- is a landmark,	0
of course it'll be um "Vista".	0
And um	0
this is about as much as we can  do	0
if we don't w- if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify	0
"O_K, if it's  this  and  this  but  that  is not the case", and so forth, it just gets really really messy.	0
O_K, I'm sorry. You're - you're -	0
Hmm?	0
It was  much  too quick for me.	0
O_K, so let me see if I understand what you're saying.	0
So, I - I  do  understand that	1
uh you can take the M_-three-L_ and	1
add not - and it w-	1
and you  need  to do this, for sure, we have to add, you know, not too much about	1
um	1
object types and stuff,	1
and what I  think  you did	1
is add some rules  of the style that are already  there  that say	1
"If it's of type "Landmark", then you	1
take - you're gonna take a picture of it."	1
Exactly.	0
F- full stop, I mean, that's what you do.	0
Ev- every landmark you take a picture of,	0
Every public place you enter, and statue you want to go as near as possible.	0
you enter -	0
You approach.	0
O_K.	0
Uh,	0
and certainly you can add rules like that to	0
the existing SmartKom system.	0
And you just did, right? O_K.	0
Yeah.	1
And it - it would do us no good. That - Ultimately.	1
Ah.	0
W-	0
Well.  So, s- well, and let's think about this.	0
Um,	0
that's a - that's another kind of baseline case, that's another sort of thing "O_K,	1
here's a - another kind of minimal	1
uh way of tackling this".	1
Add extra properties, a deterministic rule for every property you have an action, "pppt!"	1
You  do  that.	0
Um,  then  the question would be	0
Uh	0
Now, if that's  all  you're doing,	0
then you can get the types from the  ontology,	0
O_K? because	0
that's all - you're - all you're  using  is this type - the types in the ontology and you're  done.	0
Hmm?	0
Right? So we don't - we don't use the  discourse,  we don't use the  context,  we don't do  any  of those things.	0
No.	0
Alright, but that's -	0
but that's O_K, and I mean it- it's again a kind of	0
one minimal extension	0
of the existing things.	0
And that's something the uh	0
SmartKom people  themselves  would - they'd say "Sure, that's no problem - you know, no problem to add types to the ont-" Right?	0
Yeah.	0
No. And this is - just in order to exemplify what - what we can do very, very easily is, um we have	0
this - this silly	0
uh interface and we have	0
the rules that are as banal as  of  we just saw, and we have our content. Now, the content -	0
Hmm.	0
I - whi- which is sort of what - what we see  here,  which is sort of the Vista, Schema, Source, Path, Goal, whatever. This will	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
um be um a job to find ways of writing down	0
Image schema, X_schema, constructions, in some - some form,	0
and have this be in a - in a - in the content, loosely called "Constructicon".	0
And the  rules  we want to throw away  completely.	1
And um - and here is exactly where what's gonna be replaced with our Bayes-net, which is exactly getting the input feeding into here.  This  decides	1
whether it's an- whether action - the - the Enter, the Vista,	0
or the whatever	0
Uh, " approach ", you called it, I think  this  time.	0
uh	0
Approach um construction should be activated,	0
That's what you  said  - Yeah, that's fine.	0
I_E just pasted in.	0
Yeah, but -	0
Right. But it's  not   construction  there, it's  action.	0
Construction  is a d- is a different story.	0
Yeah.	0
Right. This is uh - so what we'd be generating would be	0
a reference to a semantic	0
uh like parameters for the -	0
For - for - for -	0
for the X_schema?	0
Yes.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
So that - that uh i- if you had the	1
generalized "Go" X_schema and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones, then you would have to supply the parameters.	1
Right.	0
And  then	0
uh, although we haven't worried about this yet, you might wanna worry about something that would	0
go to the G_I_S	0
and use that to actually get	0
you know, detailed route planning. So, you know, where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
But that's	0
not - It's not the  immediate  problem.	0
Right.	0
But, presumably that - that - that functionality's there when - when we -	0
So the immediate problem is just deciding w-	1
which -	1
Aspects of the X_schema to add.	1
Yeah, so the pro- The  immediate  problem is - is back t- t- to what you were - what you are doing with the belief-net. You know,	1
Yeah.	0
uh what are we going to use to make this decision -	1
Right and then, once we've made the decision, how do we put that into the content?	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Right. Well,  that  -  that  actually is relatively  easy  in this  case.	1
O_K.	0
The  harder  problem is	1
we decide what we want to  use,  how are we gonna  get  it?	1
And  that  the - the -  that's  the hardest problem. So, the  hardest  problem is	0
how are you going to  get  this information	0
from some combination of the -	0
what the person says and the context and the ontology.	0
The h-	0
So, I think that's the hardest problem at the moment is - is	0
O_K.	0
where are you gonna - how are you gonna g-  get  this information.	0
Um, and that's - so, getting back to here, uh, we have a d- a technical problem with the belief-nets that we - we	1
don't want all the com-	1
There's just too many factors right now.	0
too many factors if we - if we allow them to just go combinatorially.	1
Right.	0
So we wanna think about which ones we really care about	0
and what they  really  most depend on, and can we c- you know, clean this - this up to the point where it -	0
So what we really wanna do i- cuz this is really just the three layer	0
net, we wanna b-	0
Right.	0
make it - expand it out into more layers basically?	0
We  might.	0
Uh,	0
I mean that - that's certainly one thing we can do. Uh, it's true that	0
the way you have this,	0
a lot of the times you have -	0
what you're having is the  values  rather than the  variable.	0
So uh -	0
Right.	0
O_K? So you -	0
So instead of in- instead it should really be - just be "intention" as a node instead of "intention business" or "intention tour".	0
Yeah, right, and then it would have values, uh, "Tour", "Business", or uh "Hurried".	0
Right.	0
But then - but i- it still some knowledge design to do, about i- how do you wanna break this up, what really matters.	0
Right.	0
I mean, it's fine.	0
You know, we have to - it's - it's iterative. We're gonna have to work with it some.	0
I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have	0
a business intention and a touring intention and	0
the probabilities of	0
both of them happening at the same time -	0
Well, you - you could  do  that. And it's perfectly O_K  to uh insist that - that, you know,  th-	0
um, they add up to  one,	0
but that there's uh - that - that it doesn't have to be one zero  zero.	0
Mmm. O_K.	0
O_K. So you could have the conditional p-	0
So the -	0
each  of these things is gonna be a - a - a  probability.	0
So whenever there's a choice,	0
uh -	0
so like  landmark-ness  and  usefulness,  O_K -	0
Well, see I don't think  those  would be mutually -	0
it seems like something could both be -	0
Absolutely right.	0
O_K.	0
And so that you might want to then have those b-	0
Th- Then they may have to be separate. They may not be able to be values of the same	0
variable.	0
Object type, mm-hmm.	0
So that's - but again, this is - this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through.	0
Yeah, this is just more	0
me taking last - the last one, and saying "how can I formalize this?"  @@	0
Right.	0
It's - you know, it's great - is - is, you know, as one step toward uh -	0
toward where we wanna go.	0
Also it strikes me that we - we m- may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a -	0
uh, a specification for some interface, here that um	0
takes the normal M_-three-L_, looks at it. Then we discussed in our pre-edu - E_D_U meeting um how to ask the ontology, what to ask the ontology	0
um the fact that we can pretend we have one, make a dummy until we get the  real  one,	0
and so um we -	0
we  may  wanna decide we can do this from here, but we also could do it um	0
you know if we have a - a - a belief-net interface.	0
So the belief-net takes as input, a vector, right?	1
of stuff.	0
And it -	0
Yeah.	0
And um it- Output is whatever,	0
as well.	0
But this information is just M_-three-L_,	0
and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology and we want to look up some more stuff	1
in the - maybe we want to ask the real world, maybe you want to look something up in the G_R_S, but also we definitely want to	1
look up in the dialogue history um some s- some stuff. Based on we - we have uh - I was just made some examples from the ontology	1
and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a - a - a building and it has doors and stuff like this, but it is also an institution, so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth	0
and we get relations out of it and once we  have  them, we can use  that  information to look in the dialogue history, "were any of  these  things that - that are part of the town hall as an  institution  mentioned?", "were any of these that make the town hall a  building  mentioned?",	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
and so forth, and maybe draw some inferences on that. So this may be a - a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector, that we feed into the belief-net, and then -	1
Yeah. I think that's - I think that's exactly right.	1
There  will  be  rules,  but they aren't rules that come to final  decisions,  they're rules that gather information for a decision process.	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah, no I think that's - that's just fine.	0
Uh,  yeah.  So they'll - they - presumably there'll be	0
a thread or process or something that "Agent",	0
yeah, "Agent", whatever you wan- wanna say, yeah,	0
that uh is rule-driven, and can - can uh -	0
can do things like that. And um there's an issue about whether there will be - that'll be the  same  agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries  out  the decision, so it probably  will.	0
My guess is it'll be the same basic agent that um	1
can go off and get information,	1
run it through a - a c- this belief-net that -	1
Turn the crank, yeah.	0
turn a crank in the belief-net, that'll come out with s-	0
uh more - another vector,	0
O_K,	1
which can then be	1
uh applied	1
at what we would call the simulation or action end. So you now know what you're gonna do and	1
that may actually involve getting  more  information. So on- once you pull that out, it could be that that says "Ah! Now that we know that we gonna go ask the ontology something else."	1
Mmm.	0
O_K? Now that we  know  that it's a  bus  trip,	0
O_K? we didn't - We didn't need to know beforehand, uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever, but - but now that	0
we  know  that's the way it's coming out then we gotta go find out more. So I think that's O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So this is actually, s- if - if we  were  to build something that	0
is um,	0
and, uh, I had one more thing,	0
the -	0
it needs to do -	0
Yeah.	0
I think we - I - I can come up with a - a code for a module that we call the "cognitive dispatcher",	1
O_K.	0
which does nothing, but it looks  of complect  object trees and decides how - are there parts missing that need to be filled out, there's - this is maybe something that this module can do, something that this module can do and then collect	1
uh sub-objects and then	1
recombine them and put them together.	1
So maybe this is actually some - some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it,	0
and uh	0
Oh, O_K. Uh.	0
get this part, then. Yeah.	0
I confess, I'm still	0
not completely comfortable with the overall story. Um.	0
I-	0
i- This - this is not a complaint, this is a promise to do more work.	0
So I'm gonna hafta think about it some more. Um.	0
In particular -	0
see what we'd  like  to do,	0
and - and this has been implicit in the discussion,	0
is to	0
do  this in such a way that you get a lot of  re-use.	0
So. What you're trying to get out of this deep co- cognitive linguistics	1
is the fact that w- if you know about source - source,  paths   and goals, and nnn  all this sort of stuff,	1
that a  lot  of this is the  same,	1
for different tasks. And that -	1
uh there's - there's some - some important generalities that you're  getting,  so that you  don't  take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re- do  it.	1
And I don't  yet  see how that  goes.	1
There're no primitives upon which  uh yeah.	0
Alright.	0
u- u-	0
What are the primitives, and how do you break this -	0
So I y- I'm just -	0
just there saying eee  well you - I know how to do any  individual  case,	0
Right.	0
right? but I  don't  yet - see what's the  really  interesting question is can you use uh deep	0
uh cognitive  linguistics  to  get powerful generalizations.	0
And um	0
Yep.	0
Maybe we sho- should we a- add then the "what's this?"	0
domain?	0
N-	0
I mean, we have to "how do I get to X_".	0
Then we also have the "what's this?" domain,	0
Right.	0
Could.  Uh.	0
where we get some slightly different -	0
Um  Johno,  actually, does not allow us to call them "intentions" anymore. So he - he dislikes the term.	0
Yeah.	0
I didn't  @@ .	0
Well, I -  I  don't like the term  either,  so I have n-  i-  uh	0
i- i- y- w- i- i-	0
It uh -	0
But um, I'm sure the "what's this?" questions also create some interesting X_schema aspects.	0
Could be. I'm not a - I'm not op- particularly opposed to adding that or any other task, I mean, eventually we're gonna want a whole range of them.	0
So.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
That's right.	0
Uh,	0
I'm just saying that	0
I'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this. I just at the moment don't know. H-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Do you mean in the sense of "is there a way we can generalize the Bayes-net", or -	0
No. Well, no the Bayes - the Bayes-nets -	0
Seems like it has to be specific.	0
The Bayes-nets will be dec- specific for each decision. But what I'd like to be able to do	1
O_K.	0
is to have the way that you extract properties,	1
that will go into different Bayes-nets, be	1
the - uh  general.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
So that if you have sources, you have trajectors and stuff like that, and there's a language for  talking  about trajectors,	1
you  shouldn't  have to do that  differently	1
Right. O_K.	0
for uh uh going to something, than for circling it, for uh telling someone else how to go there,  whatever  it is.	1
Getting out of -	0
So that - that, the -	0
the  decision  processes are gonna be different	0
What you'd  really  like of course is the same thing you'd  always  like which is that you have	1
um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o- over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs.	1
So all sorts of different tasks	0
and all sorts of different ways of  expressing  them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going  on.	0
And	0
that's - that would be the really  pretty  result.	0
Right.	0
And	0
pushing it one step further, when you get to construction grammar and stuff, what you'd like to be able to do is say you have this  parser  which is much fancier than the parser that comes with	0
uh SmartKom, i- that - that actually  uses  constructions and is able to tell  from  this  construction	0
The SmartKom.	0
that there's uh something about the intent - you know, the actual what people wanna do or what they're referring to and stuff,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
in- independent of	0
whether it - about - what is this or where is it or something,	0
that you could tell  from  the construction, you could pull out deep semantic information which you're gonna use in a general  way.	0
Somehow you'd know that you needed to find out whether there - something was a landmark or something like that?	0
So that's the -	0
You  might.	0
Yeah.	0
You might.	0
You might be able to - to uh	0
say that this i- this is the  kind  of construction	0
in which the -	0
there's - Let's say there's a uh cont-	0
there - the - the land-	0
the construction  implies  the there's a con- this thing is being viewed as a  container.	0
Mmm.	0
O_K.	0
So just from this local construction	0
you know that you're gonna  hafta  treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information. And that may effect the way you process everything else.	0
So if you say "how do I get  into  the castle"	0
O_K,	0
Right.	0
then um -	0
Or,  you know, "what  is  there in the castle" or - so there's all sorts of things you might ask	0
that involve the castle as a  container	0
and you'd  like  to have this  orthogonal  so that  anytime  the castle's referred to as a container,	0
you crank up the appropriate stuff.	0
Right.	0
Independent of what the  goal  is, and independent of what the surrounding  language  is.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Alright, so that's - that's the - that's the thesis level uh -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
It's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs	0
because they're really fancy then, in - in -	0
for these kinds of analysis.	0
But uh.	0
Well, you have prepositional phrases that -	0
Yeah, but they're - they're easier for  parsers.  Parsers can pick those up but - but the - with the spatial adverbs,	0
Right.	0
they have a tough time. Because the -	0
mean- the semantics are very complex in that.	0
Right.	0
O_K, yeah?	0
I had one more  thing. I don't remember. I just forgot it again.	0
No .	0
Oh yeah, b- But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to - to throw this away and - and replace it with something else, or whatever, so that we have - so that this is sort of the representational formats we're - we're - we're talking about that are independent of the problem,	1
that generalize over those problems, and are	1
oh, t- of a higher quality than an- any actual whatever um	1
belief-net, or	1
"X_" that we may use for the decision making,	1
ultimately.	1
Should be decoupled, yeah.	0
O_K.	0
Right.	0
So, are we gonna be meeting  here  from now on? I'm - I'm happy to  do  that. We - we had  talked  about it, cuz you have th- th- the display and everything, that seems fine.	0
Yeah, um, Liz also asks whether we're gonna have presentations  every  time. I don't think we will  need  to do that but it's - so far I think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and - and -	0
Right.	0
Oh yeah. No I -	0
I think it's worth it	0
to ass- to meet here	0
to bring this, and assume that something may come  up  that we wanna look at.	0
Yeah.	0
I mean. Why not.	0
And um.	0
Yeah, that was my -	0
She was  good.  Litonya was  good.	0
Yeah? The uh - um, she w- she was  definitely  good in the sense that she - she showed us some of the weaknesses	0
Right.	0
and um	0
also the um -	0
the fact that she was a  real  subject you know, is - is -	0
Right.	0
Yeah, and - and - and - yeah and - and she took it seriously and stuff l- No, it was great.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
So  I  think that um - I mean, w- Looking - just  looking  at this data,  listening  to it, what can we get out of it in terms of  our  problem,	0
for example, is, you know,	0
she actually m- said - you know,	0
she never s- just spoke about entering, she just wanted to get someplace, and she said for buying stuff.	0
Nuh?	0
So this is definitely interesting, and -	0
Yeah, right.	0
Um, and in the other case, where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti,	0
also,  of course, not in the sentence "How do you  get  there?" was pretty standard.	0
Nuh?	0
except that there was a nice anaphora,	0
you know,	0
for pointing at what she talked about  before,  and there she was talking about looking at  pictures  that are painted inside a  wall-  on walls, so	0
Right.	0
Actually, you'd need a lot of world knowledge. This would have been a classical um uh "Tango", actually. Um,	0
Yeah.	0
because graffiti is usually found on the  outside  and not on the  inside,  but	0
O_K.	0
So the mistake  would have make a mistake - the system would have made a mistake here.	0
Yep.	0
Click?	0
Alright.	0
