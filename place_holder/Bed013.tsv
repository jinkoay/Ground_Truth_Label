I almost forgot  about the meeting.	0
I woke up twenty minutes ago, thinking,	0
Oy.	0
what did I forget?	0
It's great how the br-  brain  sort of  does  that.	0
Something's not right here.	0
Internal alarms.	0
O_K.	0
So the news for me is A_, my	0
forthcoming travel plans	0
in two weeks	0
Yes.	0
from today?	0
Yeah?	0
More or less?	0
I'll be off to Sicily and Germany	0
for a couple, three days.	0
Now what are y- what are you doing there? I forgot?	0
O_K, I'm flying to Sicily basically to drop off Simon	0
there with his grandparents. And then I'm flying to Germany t- to go to [MASK] which is	0
the meeting of all the module-responsible people in [MASK]	0
Mmm.	0
and, represent I_C_I	0
and myself I guess	0
there.	0
And um.	0
That's the	0
mmm	0
actual reason.	0
And then I'm also going up to [MASK]	0
for a day, and then I'm going to	0
meet the  very  big boss, Wolfgang Walster,	0
in Saarbruecken and the   System   system integration people in Kaiserslautern	0
and then I'm flying back via Sicily	0
pick up my son	0
come back here on the fourth of July.	0
What a great time to be coming back to the U_S_-of-A_.	0
And uh.	0
God bless America.	0
You'll see maybe - see the fireworks from your plane coming in.	0
And I'm sure all the - the people at the airport will be  happy  to work on that day.	0
Yeah.	0
You'll get even better service than usual.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Wait, aren't you flying on Lufthansa though?	0
Alitalia.	0
Oh. Well then the - you know, it's not a big deal.	0
Once you  get  to the United States it'll be a problem, but	0
Yeah.	0
And um,	0
that's  that  bit of news, and the  other  bit of news is we had - you know, uh, I was visited by my	0
German project manager	0
who A_, did like what we did -	0
what we're doing here, and B_,	0
is planning to come here either three weeks in July or three weeks in  August,	0
to actually  work.	0
On - ?  Oh.	0
With us.	0
And we sat around and we talked and he came up - we came up - with a	0
pretty strange idea.	0
And that's what I'm gonna lay on you now.	0
And um, maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for  Eva	0
because she has	0
O_K.	0
been known to complain about the fact that the stuff we do here is not weird enough.	0
So this is so weird it should even	0
Uh.  O_K.	0
make  you  happy.	0
Oh great.	0
Imagine	0
if you will,	0
that we have a system that does all that understanding	0
that we want it to do	0
Mm-hmm.	0
based on utterances.	0
It should be possible	0
to make that system  produce	0
questions.	0
So if you have the knowledge of how to interpret "where is X_?"	0
Mm-hmm.	0
under given conditions,	0
situational, user, [MASK]	0
conditions,	0
you should also be able to make that same system  ask	0
"where is X_?"	0
in a sper- certain way,	0
based  on	0
certain intentions.	0
So in- instead of just being able to	0
Hmm.	0
observe  phenomenon,	0
um, and,	0
guess the intention we	0
might  be able just to	0
sort of	0
give it an intention, and make it produce an utterance.	0
Well, like in	0
A_I they generally do the	0
take in, and then they also do the generation phase, like  Nancy's  thing.	0
Or uh,	0
you  remember , in the - the hand	0
thing in one-eighty-two, like not only was it able to recognize but it was also to generate based upon situations. You mean  that  sort of thing?	0
Absolutely.	0
O_K.	0
And once you've  done  that	0
what we can do is have the system ask	0
itself.	0
And answer,	0
understand the answer,	0
ask something else,	0
and enter a dialogue with itself. So the - the ba- basic - the same idea as having two chess computers play against each other.	0
Except this smacks a little bit more of a schizophrenic computer than A_I.	0
Yeah you c- if you want, you can have two parallel  machines	0
um, asking each  other.	0
What  would that  give  us? Would  A_  be something completely weird and strange,	0
and  B_ , i-	0
That's good.	0
if you look at all the factors,	0
we will never observe	0
people	0
let's say, in wheelchairs under - you know, in - under all conditions, you know,	0
when they say "X_", and there  is  a ride at the goal, and the parking is  good,	0
we can  never  collect enough data.	0
It's - it's - it's not possible.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right, right.	0
But maybe one could do some learning.	0
If you get the system to speak to itself,	0
you may find n-	0
break downs and errors	0
and you may be able to	0
learn.	0
And make it	0
more robust, maybe learn new things.	0
And um,	0
so there's no -	0
no  end  of  potential  things one could get  out  of it,	0
if that works.	0

with us.	0

Mm-hmm.	0
"how do I get to the castle?", actually he wants to  enter.	1
Or, you know, "how do I get to X_?"	0
discussing the admission fee in the previous utterance, is a good indication.	0

So	0
we  don't  want a  hard  code,	0
[MASK]  or things, that person's	0
you know, sort of filter, or uh search [MASK]	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So what would be kind of  cool  is	1
that if we  encounter  concepts that are castle, tower, bank, hotel,	0
we run it through [MASK] and [MASK] tells us it has	1
um, admission, opening times, it has admission fees, it has this, it has that,	1
and then we - we - we make [MASK] look up, and then search dynamically through the uh,	1
for  occurrences of these things in a given	0
window	0
of utterances.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And  that  might, you know, give us additional input to [MASK]	0
Or	0

So it's not just a particular word's - O_K, so the - you're looking for a few keys that you know are cues to -	0
sorry, a few specific cues to some intention.	0
You can dynamically look up keys, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Uh, so, wait - so um, since this - since this sort of technical stuff is going over my head, the - the point is that you uh - that	0
O_K.	0
And then grep, basically.	0
when someone's talking about a castle, you know that it's the sort of thing that people are likely to wanna go  into?  Or, is it the fact that	0
if there's an admission fee, then one of the things we know about admission fees is that you pay them in order to go  in?  And then the idea of entering is active in the discourse or something? And then	0
Well	0
blah-blah-blah? I mean.	0
the - the idea is even more general. The idea is to say,	0
we encounter a certain entity in a - in a- in a utterance.	0
So le- let's look up everything we - [MASK] gives us	0
about that entity, what	0
stuff it does, what roles it has, what	0
parts,  whatever  it has.	0
Functions.	0
And, then we look	0
in the  discourse,  whether any of that, or any	0
surface structure corresponding to  these	0
Oh, O_K.	0
roles, functions aaa  has ever  occurred.	0
And then, the discourse  history  can t- tell us, "yeah", or "no".	0

And then it's up for  us	0
to decide what to  do  with it.	0
O_K.	0
t-	0
So i-	0
So -	0
No, go ahead.	0
So, we may think that if you say	0
um,	0
"where is the theater",	0
um, whether or not he has talked about  tickets  before,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
then we - he's probably wanna go there to	0
see  something.	0
O_K.	0
Or "where is the opera in Par- Paris?, yeah? Lots of people go to the opera to take pictures of it and to  look  at it, and lots of people go to attend a  performance.	0
Mm-hmm. O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And, the  discourse  can maybe tell us w- what's more  likely	0
if we know what to look for in previous statements.	0
And so we can hard code "for opera, look for tickets,  look   for this, look for that,	0
O_K.	0

or look for Mozart, look for thi-"	0
but the smarter way is to go via [MASK] and dynamically, then look up	0
u-	0
stuff.	0
O_K. But you're still doing look up so that when the person - So the point is that when the person says,	0
"where is it?"	0
then you sort of say, let's go back and look at	0
other things and then decide, rather than the other possibility which is that  all through discourse as they talk about different things - You know like w-	0
prior  to the "where is it" question they say, you know, "how much does it cost to get in, you know, to - to see a movie around here", um,	0
"where is the closest theater" - The - the - the point is that by mentioning  admission  fees, that just sort of stays active now.	0
Yeah.	0
You know. That becomes part of like, their sort of current ongoing	0
Mm-hmm.	0
active conceptual structure. And then, um,	0
over in [MASK] or whatever, when - when the person says "where is it", you've already got, you know since they were talking about  admission,  and  that  evokes the idea of  entering,  um, then when they go and ask "where is it", then you'	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, e- ultimately that's  also  what we wanna get at. I think that's - that's the correct way. So, of course we have to keep	0
memory of what was the last intention, and how does it fit to this, and what does it tell us, in terms of - of the - the - what we're examining.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mmm, yeah.	0
And furthermore,	1
I mean we can  idealize  that, you know, people don't change topics,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
but they  do.  But,	1
Right.	0
even th- for that, there is a student of ours who's doing [MASK]	0
um, [MASK]	0
Mm-hmm.	0
[MASK]	1
So,	0
maybe,  we're even in a position where we can take  your  approach, which is of course much  better,  as to say how - how do these pieces -	0
Mmm.	0
And much harder to r- program.	0
Hmm?	0
And much harder to p- to  program.	0
Yeah. How - how do these pieces fit together? Uh-huh.	0
And um. But, O_K, nevertheless. So these are issues but we - what we actually decided last  week,  is to,	1
and this is, again, for  your  benefit -	0
is to um,	0
pretend we have	0
observed and parsed an utterance such as "where is the  Powder-Tower ",	1
or "where is the zoo",	0
and specify	1
um, what - what we think the - the output	0
uh, observe, out - i- input nodes for [MASK]	1
So that - And I will - I will then	1
come up with [MASK]	0
uh, bits and pieces, so that we can say, O_K we - we  always  just look at this utterance.	1
That's the  only  utterance we can do,	0
it's hard coded, like Srini, sort of hand parsed,	0
hand crafted,	0
but this is what we hope to be able to observe in general from utterances, and from [MASK]	0
and then we can sort of	1
fiddle  with  these  things to see what it actually  produces,  in terms of  output.	1
Uh	0
So	0
we need to find out what [MASK] will give us in terms of semantics and	0
Simspec	0
type things.	0
Just - O_K. Just "where is X_"?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Or any variants of that.	0
Yeah.	0
No!	0
Um, look at it this way, i-	0
Yeah.	0
What did we decide. We decided sort of the -	0
Well we were	0
the prototypical "where is X_", where	0
you know, we don't really know, does he wanna  go  there, or just wanna know where it is.	0
So the difference of "where is the railway station", versus where - where - "where is Greenland". Nuh?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh s- I was just dancing, sorry.	0
We're not videotaping any of this. So.	0
Uh - ah -	0
So, um, we're supposed to -	0
I mean we're talking about sort of anything that has the semantics of  request  for  location,  right? actually?	0
Or,	0
I mean, anyway, the node in the uh - the ultimate, uh, in - in [MASK] when you're done, the - the node that we're talking about um, is	0
one that says	0
"request for location, true", or something like that, right? Um, and - and exactly how that gets activated, you know, like whether we want	0
Yeah, but it -	0
the sentence	0
"how do I get there?"	0
to activate that  node  or not, you know, that's - that's sort of the issue that sort of the linguistic-y side has to deal with, right?	0
Yea- Nnn-	0
Well actually more - m- more the other way around. We wanted	0
something that represents uncertainty uh we- in terms of going there or just wanting to know where it is, for example. Some generic information.	0
O_K.	0
And so	0
this is prototypically  @@  found in the "where is something" question, surface structure,	0
O_K.	0
We-	0
which can be p- you know,	0
should be maps to	0
something that activates  both.  I mean	0
the idea is to -	0
Alright, O_K.	0
I don't -	0
Hhh.	0
let's have it fit nicely with the paper. The -	0
I  guess.  I don't -	0
I don't see unde- how we would be able to distinguish between the two intentions just from the g- utterance, though.	1
I mean, uh bef- or, before we don't - before we cranked it through [MASK]  I mean.	1
Yeah, we - we  wouldn't.	0
That's exactly what we  want.	0
We  would?	0
We want to get -	0
No. We  wouldn't.	0
O_K, but then so basically it's just a - [MASK] right? And we turn on	0
Yeah.	0
that node.	0
Oy.	0
What - what is this gonna -  Exactly.  What is the uh -	0
Well -	0
And then given that we know that  the construction  has these two  things,  we can set up probabilities -	0
we can s- basically define all the  tables  for ev- for those -	0
Yeah, it should be - So we have	0
um,	0
i- let's assume we - we call something like [MASK]	0
And what we actually  get  if we  just  look at the  discourse,	0
"where is X_" should activate	0
or should -	0
Mmm.	0
Hmm. Should be  both,	0
whereas maybe "where is X_  located ",	0
we find from the  data,  is  always  just asked when the person wants to  know  where it is,	0
and "how do I get to" is always asked when the person	0
just  wants to know how to  get  there.	0
Right?	0
So	1
we want to sort of	0
come up with	0
what  gets	0
uh,  input,  and  how  inter- in case of a "where is" question.	1
So what - what would the outcome of - of your parser look like?	1
And, what other discourse information from the discourse history could we hope to get,	1
squeeze  out of that  utterance?	1
So define the - the  input  into [MASK]	1
based on what the utterance, "where is X_", gives us.	1
So definitely	0
have [MASK] here	0
s-	0
which is activated via [MASK] so	0
"where is X_" produces something that is s- stands for  X_ , whether it's castle, bank, restroom, toilet, whatever. And then [MASK] will tell us -	0
That it has a  location  or something like that? - or th- [MASK] will tell us where actually it is located?	0
No.	0
O_K.	0
Not at all. Where it is located, we have, [MASK] here somewhere,	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
e- which tells us how far the user - how far away the user is in respect to that uh entity.	0
O_K.	0
So you're talking about, for instance, the construction obviously involves this entity or refers - refers to this entity,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and	0
from the construction also you know that it is a location - is - or a thing -	0
thing that can be located.	0
Right? [MASK] says this thing has a location slot.	0
Sh- and that's the thing that is being -	0
that is the content of the question that's being queried by	0
one  interpretation of "where is X_".	0
And  another  one is, um,	0
path from current - user current location to	0
Mm-hmm.	0
that location. So.	0
So is the question - I mean it's just that I'm not sure what the -	0
Is the question, for this  particular  construction how we specify that  that's  the information it provides?	0
Or -	0
or asked for?	0
b-	0
Both sides, right?	0
Yeah, you don't need to	0
even do that. It's just sort of what	0
what would be	0
@@	0
observed	0
in uh - in that case.	0
Observed when you heard the speaker say "where is X_", or when - when that's been parsed?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So these little circles you have by the D_?	0
Is that - ?	0
That's exactly what we're looking for.	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
I d- I just - I don't like having - characterizing the constructions with location and path,	0
or li-  characterizing   them   like that. Cuz you don't -	0
It seems like in the  general  case you wouldn't know	0
You  wouldn't.	0
how - how to characterize them. I mean - or, for  when.  There could be an interpretation that we don't have a  node  for in the -	0
I mean it just seems like  @@  has to have uh - a node for the construction	0
and then let the chips fall where they  may.	0
Versus	0
uh,	0
saying, this construction either can mean location or path.	0
And, in this cas- and since - since it can mean either of those things, it would light both of those up.	0
It's the same.	0
Thoughts?	0
Questions?	0
I'm thinking about it. Um -	0
It  will  be the same. So I think	0
r- in here we have "I'll go there", right?	0
Answers?	0
And we have [MASK]	0
So in my c- my case, this would	1
sort of make  this   happy, and this would make [MASK]  happy.	1
What  you're  saying is we have [MASK]	0
that makes  both  happy.	0
Right? That's what you're proposing, which is, in my mind  just  as fine.	0
So w- if we have [MASK] "where is X_",	1
it's gonna	0
both	0
get the	0
po- [MASK] that - it'	1
Mmm, yeah.	0
[MASK]  and th	1
Which would be exactly analogous to what I'm proposing is,	1
this makes -	0
uh	0
makes something  here  true, and this makes something -  also  something here true, and this makes  this  True-up, and this makes this [MASK] as well.	1
I kinda like it better  without that  extra level of indirection too. You know with - with this points to this points to that, and so on because  I don't know, it -	1
Yeah, because we get - we get  tons  of constructions I think. Because,	0
Is- uh,	0
Yeah.	0
you know, mmm people have many ways of asking for the same  thing,  and -	0
Yeah, sure.	0
Yeah.	0
So un-	0
I change- I changed my mind actually.	0
O_K.	0
So I agree with that. I have a different kinda question,	0
might  be related,	0
which is, O_K so implicitly everything in [MASK] we're  always  inferring the speaker	0
intent, right?	0
Like,  what  they  want	0
either, the information that they want, or -	0
It's always information that they want probably, of some kind.	0
Right? Or I - I don't know, or what's something that they -	0
The system doesn't  massage  you, no. No.	0
I - I - I don't -	0
O_K. So, um,	0
let's see. So I don't know if the - I mean i- if th-	0
just there's more s- here that's not shown that you - it's already like part of the system whatever,	0
but, "where is X_",	0
like, the fact that it is, you know, [MASK] whatever,	0
it  is  a question. It's a question that,	0
um, queries on some particular thing X_, and X_ is that location.	0
There's, like, a lot of structure in representing that.	0
Yep. Yeah.	0
So  that  seems different from just having [MASK] and that goes int	0
Yeah.	0
Precisely.  That's - that's -	0
So, w-	0
So tha- is that what you're t-	0
Exactly. We have su- we have specified  two.	0
talking about? wh- what kinds of structure we want.	0
O_K, the next one would be here, just for mood.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
The next one would be what we can squeeze out of the uh	0
I  don't know, maybe we wanna observe the uh, um,	0
Mmm.	0
uh the length of - of the words used, and, or [MASK]	0
and g- a- and t- make conclusions about the user's  intelligence.   I  don't know, yeah.	0
O_K. So in some ways -	0
um, so in some ways in the other sort of parallel set of mo- more  linguistic  meetings we've been talking about possible semantics of some construction.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right? Where it was	0
the simulation that's,	0
according to it - you know, that - that corresponds to it, and as well the - as discourse,	0
whatever, conte- infor- in- discourse information, such as the mood, and, you know, other stuff. So,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
are we looking for a sort of abbreviation of that, that's tailored to this problem?	0
Cuz that - that has, you know, basically, you know,	0
s- it's in progress still it's in development still, but it definitely has various [MASK] attributes,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um, bindings between things -	0
Yeah.	0
U- that's exactly r- um, why I'm proposing - It's too early to have - to  think  of them - of  all  of these	0
Uh-huh.	0
discourse things that one could possibly observe,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
so let's just assume	0
For the subset of -	0
human beings are not allowed to ask anything but "where is X_".	0
O_K.	0
This is the only utterance in the world. What could we observe from that?	0
O_K. That exactly "where is X_", not	0
In ter-	0
the - the choices of "where is X_" or "how do I get to X_". Just " where  is X_". O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
Just - just "where is X_".	0
And, but you know, do it -	0
do it in such a way that we  know  that people can also say, "is the town hall in front of the  bank ",	0
so that we need something like [MASK] Nuh? Should be -	0
should be  there,  that, you know, this - the - whatever we get from the -	0
Wait, so  do,  or do  not  take other kinds of	1
constructions into account?	1
Well, if you - if you  can,  oh definitely  do,	1
O_K. Where possible. O_K.	0
where possible. Right?	0
If i- if - if it's not at all  triggered  by our thing, then it's irrelevant, and it doesn't  hurt  to leave it out for the moment.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Um, but -	0
O_K.	0
Um, it seems like for instance, "where is X_",	0
the fact that it might mean	0
um,	0
"tell me how to get to X_",	0
like -	0
Do y-	0
So, would you wanna say that those two are both, like -	0
Those are the two interpretations, right? the - the ones that are location or path.	0
So, you  could  say that the s- construction is a question asking about this location,	0
and then you can  additionally  infer, if they're asking about the location, it's because they wanna  go  to that place,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
in which case, the - you're  jumping  a  step   - step and saying, "oh, I know where it is but I also know how to get - they wanna seem - they seem to wanna get there so I'm gonna tell them". So there's like structure	0
Yeah.	0
Right, th- this - it's  not  - it's  not  that this is sort of like semantically ambiguous between these two. It's  really  about this but why would you care about this? Well,	0
i- do you kn- sort of uh, that -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
it's because you  also  want to know  this,  or something  like that  right?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So it's like you infer the speaker intent, and then infer a plan, a larger plan from that, for which you have the additional information, you're just being extra helpful. Um.	1
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yep.	0
Think - Uh, well this is just a  mental  exercise. If you think about,	1
Yeah.	0
focus on this question, how would you design  that?	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Is it -	0
do you feel confident about saying this is  part  of the  language   already  to - to  detect  those plans, and why would anyone care about location, if not, you know	0
Mmm.	0
and so forth.	0
Or do you actually,	0
I mean this is  perfectly   legitimate,  and I - I would  not  have any problems with erasing this and say,	0
that's all we can activate, based on the utterance out of context.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And just by an additional link -	0
Oh.	0
What?	0
Right.	0
Right, like,	0
And then the - the - the  miracle  that we get out the intention,  [MASK]	0
with context and enough user information, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
happens, based on what we know about that entity, about the user, about his  various  beliefs, goals, desires, blah-blah-blah.	0
Absolutely fine.	0
But this is the sort of thing, I - I  propose  that we  think  about,	0
O_K.	0
so that we actually end up with um,	1
um,	0
[MASK]	1
so that we can put  them   into [MASK]	1
never  change  them,	0
so we - all there is is "where is X_",	0
and, Eva can play around with the observed things, and we can run our better [MASK] and have it produce some  output.  And for the first time in th- in -	1
in the  world,  we look at our  output,  and um - and see uh whether it -	0
it's any  good.	0
O_K.	0
You know? I mean,	0
Here's  hoping.	0
Hmm?	0
Here's hoping. Right?  Now  cross your fingers.	0
Yeah, I - I mean, for  me  this is just a ba-  matter   of curiosity, I wanna -	0
Yeah.  Yeah.	0
would like to look at uh,	0
what this ad-hoc process of designing [MASK] would actually produce.	0
Mmm.	0
If - if we ask it where is something.	0
And, maybe it also h-	0
enables you to think about certain things more specifically,	0
um, come up	0
with interesting questions, to which you can find interesting answers.	0
And, additionally it might	0
fit in  really  nicely with the paper.	0
Um-hmm.	0
Because if - if - if we want an example for the  paper,	0
I suggest there it  is.	0
Yeah.	0
So th- this might be a nice opening  paragraph  for the paper as saying,	1
"you know people look at kinds of -  at ambiguities", and	1
um,	0
in the literature there's "bank"	0
and	0
Mm-hmm.	0
whatever kinds of [MASK]	0
And we can say, well, that's all nonsense.	0
A_, uh these things are  never   really  ambiguous in discourse,	1
B_, don't ever  occur  really in discourse, but	1
normal  statements that seem completely unambiguous, such as "where is the blah-blah",	0
Mm-hmm.	0
actually are terribly complex, and completely ambiguous.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And so, what every- everybody else has been doing so far in - in - in - you know, has been completely nonsensical, and can all go into the wastepaper bin,	0
That's always a good way to begin. Yeah. Yeah.	0
and the only -	0
Yeah.	0
And the - the - the only -	0
I am great.	0
All others are useless.	0
Yeah.	0
That's good.	0
Yeah.	0
Nice overture, but, you know, just not really -	0
O_K, I'm eja- exaggerating, but that might be, you know,	0
saying "hey", you know,	0
some stuff is - is actually	0
complex, if you look at it in - in - in the  vacuum	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and - and ceases to be complex in reality. And some stuff that's as - that's absolutely straightforward in the vacuum,	0
is actually terribly complex in reality.	0
Would be nice sort of, uh, also, nice, um	0
[MASK] um,	0
type message.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
True.	0
Versus the old top-down school.	0
I'm running out of time. O_K.	0
When do you need to start [MASK]	0
At four ten.	0
O_K, this is the other bit of news.	0
The subjects today know Fey, so she can't be here, and do [MASK]	0
Huh.	0
So I'm gonna do [MASK] and Thilo's gonna do the instructing. Also we're getting a - a person who just got fired	1
Mmm.	0
uh, from her job.	1
Uh a person from Oakland who is interested in maybe  continuing  the wizard bit once Fey  leaves  in August.	1
And um, she's gonna look at it	0
today.	0
Which is good news in the sense that if we  want  to continue,	0
after the thir-	0
thir- after July, we can. We could.	0
And, um -	0
and that's also	0
maybe interesting for Keith and whoever,	0
if you wanna get some more stuff  into  the data collection.	0
Remember this, we can completely change the set-up any time we want.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
Look at the results we've gotten  so  far for the first,	1
whatever, fifty some	0
subjects?	1
Fifty? You've had fifty so far, or - ?	0
No, we're approaching twenty now. But, until Fey is	1
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
leaving, we surely will hit the -	0
some  of  the higher numbers.	1
Hmm.	0
And um,	0
so that's cool.	0
Can	0
a-	0
do more  funky  stuff.	0
Sure.	0
Yeah, I'll have to look more into that data. Is that around? Like, cuz that's pretty much getting posted or something right away when you get it? Or - ? I guess it has to be transcribed, huh?	0
Um.	0
We have uh, eh found someone here who's hand st- hand transcribing the first twelve.	1
O_K.	0
First dozen subjects	0
Uh-huh.	0
just so we can build a - a language model for the recognizer.	0
O_K.	0
But, um - So those should be available soon.	0
O_K.	0
The first twelve. And	0
I can ch- ch- st- e-	0
You know -	0
I mean you know that I - that I looked at the first - the first one and got enough data to keep me going for, you know, probably most of July. So.	0
But, um.	0
Yeah, a-  probably  not the right way to do it actually.	0
But you can listen to -	0
a- y- y- y- You can listen to  all  of them from [MASK]	0
O_K.	0
If you want.	0
Right.	0
It's always fun.	0
