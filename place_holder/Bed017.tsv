In what order shall we proceed?	0
Maybe you have your on-line -	0
Um, so, I've be- just been looking at, um,	0
I've  been looking at the P_R_M stuff. Um,	1
so, this is, sort of like the latest	0
thing I have on it, and	0
I sorta constructed a couple of  classes.  Like, a  user  class, a  site  class, and -	1
and you know, a  time,  a  route,  and then and a  query  class.	1
tried to simplify it down a little bit, so that I can actually	1
um, look at it more. It's the same paper that	0
I gave to Jerry last time. Um,	0
so basically I took out a lot of stuff, a lot of the decision nodes,	0
tried to The red lines on the,	1
um, graph are the um,	1
and then, also has, you know	0
um, reference slots to its preferences, um, the special needs and, you know, money, and	0
this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes-net that I have, you know, with	1
the input nodes and all that.	1
So I tried to construct the dependency models, and	1
a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes-net,  and  what they depend on,	1
and it turns out, you know, the C_P_T's are really big, if I do that, so I tried to see	1
how I can do, um put in the computational nodes in between.	0
look  like in a P_R_M.	0
And so I ended up	1
Actually, you know, a class of with different attributes that	1
are the intermediate nodes, and one of  them   is like, time affordability	1
money affordability, site availability, and	1
And so some of these classes are -	0
s- some of these attributes only depend on stuff from, say, the  user,  or s- f- just from, I don't know, like the  site.	0
um, these here, it's only like,	0
user,  but, if you look at travel compatibility	1
for each of these factors,	1
you need to look at a pair of, you know, what the	1
um, preference of the user is	1
versus, you know, what type of an event it is, or	1
which form of transportation the user has	0
and whether, you know, the onsite parking matters to the user, in that case.	0
that makes the scenario a little different in a P_R_M, because, um,	1
then you have  one-user  objects and  potentially  you can have many different sites	0
for each of the site you'll come up with this	0
And, they all depend on the same users, but different sites, and that makes a -	0
I'm tr- I w- I wa- have been trying to see	0
whether the P_R_M would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that.	0
I guess you end up having	0
fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes-net, cuz otherwise you would -	0
it's probably the same . But um,	0
No, you would definitely have -	0
all the user stuff, and not -	0
not having to recompute a lot of  the   stuff, because it's all from the user side. So if you changed sites, you -	0
you can, you know, save some work on that.	0
you know, in the case where, it depends on both the user and the site, then	0
I'm still having a hard time trying to see how	0
um, using the P_R_M will help.	0
Um, so anyhow, using those intermediate nodes then,	1
this this would be the class that	1
And that would  basically  it's just another class in the model,	1
with, you know, references to the user and the site and	1
And then, after you group them together this -	0
no- the dependencies would -	0
of the queries would be	0
reduced to this. And so, you know, it's easier to specify the C_P_T and all.	1
Um, so I think that's about as far as I've gone	0
So y- you didn't yet tell us what the  output  is.	0
So what decisions does this  make?	0
O_K. So it only makes two decisions, in this model.	1
basically how desirable a site is	1
how good it matches the needs of a user. And the other is the mode	1
of the visit, whether th- It's the E_V_A decision.	1
doing a lot of, you know,	0
computation about, you know, which one site it wants of the user wants to visit, I'll come -	0
well, try to come up with like, sort of a list of sites.	0
And for each site, you know, where h- how how well it fits, and basically a rating of how well it fits and	0
what to do with it.	0
So that was pretty quick. She's ac- uh uh Eva's got a little write-up on it that	0
uh, probably gives the the details to anybody who  needs  them. Um,	0
You you didn't look at all yet to see if there's anybody has a  implementation .	1
No, not yet, um -	0
O_K. So one so one of the questions, you know, about these P_R_Ms is	1
uh, we aren't gonna build our own	1
interpreter, so if if we can't  find  one, then  we  uh, go off and do something else and wait until s- one appears.	1
Uh, so one of the things that Eva's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down.	1
the people at Stanford write papers as  if  they had one,	1
um,  we'll  see. So w-  Anyway.  So that's	1
a a  major  open issue.	1
an  interpreter,  it looks like	0
you know, what Eva's got should run and we should be able to actually	0
um, try to solve, you know, the  problems,  to actually take the data, and  do  it.	0
Uh, and we'll  see.  Uh,  I  actually think it is	1
cleaner, and the ability to instantiate, you know, instance of people and sites and stuff, um,	1
will  help  in the  expression.  Whether the  inference  gets any faster or not I don't know. Uh, it wouldn't surprise me if it if it  doesn't.	0
You know, it's the same kind of information. I think there are things that you can express	0
this way which you  can't  express in a normal belief-net,	0
uh, without going to some incredible hacking  of  sort of rebuilding it on the fly. I mean, the notion of instantiating	1
the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into	1
the extended belief-net. So that was one of the main reasons for doing it.	1
I don't know. So, uh, people who have thought about the problem, like Robert	0
i- it looked to  me  like if	0
Eva were  able  to come up with	0
you know, value for each of a number of uh, sites  plus  its E_V_A thing,	0
that a travel planner should be able to take it from there.	0
you know, with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever,	0
and then plan a route.	0
Um-hmm, um,  well, first of all uh,	0
mu- much cleaner, nnn, nnn,	0
Certain certain beauty in it, so, um, if beauty is truth, then, uh we're in good shape.	0
as, uh, mentioned before we probably  should  look at t- the details. So if you have a write-up then uh, I'd love to read it and uh -	0
because, um, i- Can you go all the way back to the the very top?	0
Um,  uh these  @@   these w- w- when these are instantiated they take on the same values? that we had before? or are they -	0
I can't really see the whole thing.	0
Well I think I basically leave them to similar things.	0
Some of the things might -	0
that might be different, maybe like -	0
are that the hours for the site.	0
eventually I meant that to mean whether they're open at this hour or not.	0
And  status  would be, you know, more or less like, whether they're under construction, and and or	0
other  question I would have is that  presumably,  from the way the  Stanford  people talk about it,	1
the probabilities also on the  relations.	1
Which is the structural uncertainty?	0
That  I think was  actually  in the previous -	0
the  Ubenth  stuff. I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not,	0
It's sort of in the definition or in the in  Daphne's  definition of a P_R_M is that	0
classes and  relations,  and you're gonna have C_P_T's over the classes  and  their relations.	0
More uncertainty, or or -	0
I remember them learning when, you know, you don't know the structure for sure, but I don't remember reading how you  specify	1
Yeah, that would be exactly my question. Well -	0
wh- to start with. Yeah. Yeah.	0
So, uh, the the plan is is when Daphne gets back,	1
we'll get in touch and supposedly,	1
get s- deep seriously connected to to their work and	1
somebody'll Uh, you know If it's a	1
group  meeting once a week probably someone'll go down and,  whatever.	1
So, we'll actually figure all this out.	0
I think the w-  long term perspective is is pretty clear.	0
rocking and rolling on this again, once we get a package, if, when, and how, then	0
until then we'll come up with a something that's  @@	0
that's  way  more complicated for you.	0
Because this was laughingly easy, right?	0
take out a lot of the complicated stuff, cuz I I made it really complicated in the beginning, and	0
Jerry was like,  "this is just too much".	0
from  this, go on and say suppose there's a group of people traveling together	0
and you wanted to plan something that somehow,	0
uh,  uh, thing for -	0
That's  definitely a job for artificial intelligence.	0
Well that's not not even something  humans  yeah.	0
Except for humans can't really solve it either, so.	0
Right. Right. Well that's the that would that would be a uh, you could  sell  it, as a O_K,  eh  you don't have to fight about this, just give your preferences to the -	0
And then you can blame the computer. So.	0
But what does it uh Would a pote- potential result be to to split up and never talk to each other again? You know.	0
That  should be  one  of them.	0
So. So there i- there are some some u- uh, you know,	0
you  could  try to put in	0
to  this structure, but  I  don't think it's worth it  now.	0
Because we're gonna see what what else uh -	0
what else we're gonna do.	0
it's good, yeah and and	0
there were a couple other ideas of of	0
uh, things for Eva to look at	0
Good.  Then, we can move on and	1
see what Andreas has got out his sleeve.	1
Or Andy, for that matter?	0
So uh, uh, well, thanks for  having  me here,  first  of all. Um, so maybe just a a little background on on my  visit.  So, uh, I'm not really involved in any  project,  that's uh -	0
that's relevant to you uh, a- at the moment, uh, the the reason is really for me	0
uh, to have an opportunity to talk to some other  researchers  in the  field.  And and so I'll just n- sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I'm working on, and	0
um, I just hope that you have some comments or, maybe you're interested in it to find out more, and and so I'll be uh, happy to talk to you and and uh, I'd also like to find out some more and and maybe I'll just walk around the office and	0
and then and ask some some questions, uh, in a couple days. So I'll be here for uh, tomorrow and then uh, the remainder of uh, next week.	0
O_K, so, um, what I started looking at, uh, to begin with is just uh, content management systems uh, i- i- in  general.  So	1
um, uh what's uh Sort of the state of the art there is to um uh you have a bunch of of uh documents or learning units or learning objects,	1
um, and you store  meta-data  uh, associate to them. So there's some international standards like the I_-triple-E_, uh There's an I_-triple-E_, L_O_N standard,	1
and um, these fields are pretty straightforward, you have uh author information, you have uh, size information, format information and so on.	0
Uh, but they're two uh fields that are um, more interesting. One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh with the document, and one is uh, you have sort of a, um,	0
well, what is the document  about?  So it's some sort of taxonomic	0
uh,  ordering  of of the of the units. Now,	0
if you sort of put on your	0
uh you say, well that's not all that  easy,  because there's an implicit um, uh,  assumption  behind that is that uh, all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of	1
uh, whichever taxonomy is used, and uh,	1
I think that's a that's a very that's a key point of these systems and they sort of always	0
brush over this real quickly without	0
really elaborating much of that and uh As a matter of fact, the only thing that m- apparently  really  works out so far are  library  ordering codes, which are very, very coarse grain, so you have some like,	1
science, biology, and then But that's really all that we have at the  moment.  So I think there's a huge,	0
um, uh need for  improvement  there.	0
Now, what this uh a standard like this would give us is we could um, sort of uh with a search engine just query uh, different repositories all over the world. But we can't really -	0
Um, so what I'm what I try to do is um,	0
to have um, uh So. So the scenario is the following, you- you're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem. Now,	0
what what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh, students um, try to u-	0
program a certain assignment, for example, they always run into the same	0
uh, and they always come running to us, and they'll say why's it not it's not working, and we always give out the same answer, so we thought, well, it'd be nice to have a  system  that could sort of take  care  of this, and	1
so, what I want to build is basically a a smart F_A_ Q  system.	1
uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than "I'm looking for this and this and this  keyword. " So.	1
And I think that I don't need to tell you this. I'm I'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain,	0
uh,  context  it, and and the same sentence in  another  context makes a huge difference. So,	1
I want to be able to model information like, um, so in the in the  context   of in the context of developing distributed systems, of a- at a computer science school, um,	1
what kind of software is the person using, which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment,	0
um, maybe what's the background of that student's um, which um, which  error  message was encountered.	0
So this sort of information I think should be transmitted, uh, when a certain document is retrieved.	0
basically giving this um Uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um, way of writing this  down  basically,	0
and that's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again.	0
using this and some some uh, knowledge about the domain I think you can do some some simple inferences. Like you know that when somebody's working about uh, working on on servlets for example, he's using  Java,  cuz servlets are used -	0
are written in  Java.  So some some inferences like that, now,	1
um, u- using this you can infer more information, and you could then match this to the  meta-data  of um off the documents you're you're  searching  against.	1
So, uh what I wanna do is basically have some sort of um -	0
given these  inputs,  and then I can compute how many documents match,	0
and use this as a  metric  in the  search.	0
Now, what I  plan  to  do  is I want to uh sort of do a uh -	1
uh  try to improve the quality of the search results, and I want to do this by having a depth uh, um, um steepest descent approach.	1
So if I knew which operating system the person was working on, would this improve my  search  result? And and having uh, uh a symbolic formalized  model  of this I could simply compute that,	0
and find out which um -	0
which questions are worth um, asking.	0
And that's what I then propagate back to the user, and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way.	1
problem  that I'm  facing  right now is um,	1
it's fairly easy to hack up a system uh  quickly,  that that  works  in the  small  domain, but the problem is obviously the  scalability.	1
And uh uh, so Robert was mentioning uh, earlier today is that uh, Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network,	0
which does exactly this, but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend.	0
And so, uh what I'm What I try to do is basically try to model this uh, in a way that you could really combine	0
uh, knowledge from very different sources, and and um, sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh, came up with.	0
Trying to to have uh, an approach how to integrate s- uh certain uh representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules,	0
um, what you can  do  with those.	0
What I'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure, so it's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic	1
uh, computational model. That that probably isn't expressive enough. So. So that's another thing,	1
um, which I think you're  also  uh, uh looking into right now.	0
And then um, uh sort of as an add-on to this whole idea, um, uh that would be	0
now, depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which -	0
um, uh, which uh, rules and which ontologies it it uses, or basically its view of the world,	0
uh you can get very different results. So it might ma- make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines.	0
And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach, where	0
we're all sort of carrying around our individual  bookshelves,	0
and um, if you have a question about a homework, it's probably makes sense to ask somebody who's in your class with you, sort of the guru in the certain area,	0
rather than going to some Yahoo-like uh, search engine.	0
So these are some of the just in a nutshell, some of the	0
ideas. And I think a lot of the -	1
even though it's a it's a very different domain, but I think a lot of the, um, issues are are fairly similar. So.	1
And so some of the I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project, I Are you -	0
Uh I know, yeah I know abou- about it.	0
So it seems like a lot of  some  of the issues are	0
the same. It's like, um,	0
you know, the c- context-based factors that influence how you interpret,	0
how to interpret. In in this case, infer- in- in knowing wanting to know what kinds of things to ask. We- we've kind of talked about that, but we haven't	0
worried too much about that end of the discourse. But maybe you guys had that in the previous	0
Well, in a in one t- one s- mmm,  small  difference in a in a way, is that	0
he doesn't have to come up with an answer, but he wants to point to the places w- w-	0
Yeah, so. So I'm I'm not I'm not building an  expert  Uh, I want to build a smart  librarian,  basically that can point you to the right reference. I don't wanna compute the answer,	1
Documents that have the answers.	0
so it's a little bit easier for me.	0
Well.  Uh, you have to s- still m-	0
understand what the content says about  itself,  and then match it to	0
what you think the informational needs -	0
So you also don't have to figure out what the content is. You're just taking the keywords as a topic	0
I I assume that that the- there will be learning systems that that tag their their  content.	0
m-  @@  and basically what I what I envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an F_A_Q for example you could state	0
sort of like a logic condition, when this document  applies.  So "this document	0
explains how to set up your uh, mail account on Linux" or	0
So. So something something very specific that you can then -	0
But the I think that the key point with these uh,  learning  systems is that uh, a learning system	0
is only as good as uh the amount of content it it carries. You can have the best learning system with the best	0
search interface, if there's no content inside of it,	0
it's not very useful. So I think ultimately because	0
um, uh developing these these rules and these inference uh inferences I think is very costly, so	0
um, uh I think you  must  be able to  reuse  some -	0
um, domain domain information, or or or ontologies that that uh other people wrote and then try to integrate them, and then also search the entire web basically, rather than just the small	0
So I think that's that's crucial for for the success of or  @@  -	0
I guess I'm trying to figure out how how it maps to the kinds of things	0
that we've talked about in  this  group, and, actually associated groups, cuz	1
some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses, and	1
I'm guessing that you you  won't  be doing that?	1
O_K. Just checking. So,  O_K.	0
So, you take the query, and -	0
could  well  be useful. So do you know the FrameNet story?	1
Um, yeah. Uh, not not  too  much, but uh,	0
Oh. Th- that's  another  thing you might wanna look into while you're  here.	0
I have a rough overview.	0
you know, the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames, and the frames may	0
well give you additional keywords or	0
uh, if you know that that that a a bunch of keywords uh,	0
indicate a frame, then you can find documents that actually have the whole  frame,  rather th- than just	0
uh, individual So there's a lot of stuff, and people are looking at that. Most of the work here	0
is just trying to get the  frames  right. There's linguists and stuff and there's a  lot  of it and they're they're busily working away.	0
But there are some application efforts trying to  exploit  it.	0
And this looks t- it seems to  be  that this is a place where	0
you might be able to do that.	0
Yeah. I'm sure I could learn a  lot  about um,	0
yeah, just how to how to come up with these structures, cuz it's it's very easy to whip up something quickly, but it	1
maybe then makes sense to to me, but not to anybody else, and and if we want to share and integrate things, they must -	1
well, they must be well designed really.	1
Remember the uh, Prashant story?	0
The absolutely no no linguistic background person that the I_U sent over here.	0
tried to come up wi- or we had come up actually with a eh with him working on an interface for  FrameNet,  as it was back then, that would	0
p- do some of the work for this machine,	0
which uh, never got done because Prashant found a happy occupation which in the -	0
W- yeah, I know, I mean it it he w-  he did w-  what what he did was much more s- sensible for him. I think uh,	0

The idea was there. Yeah, O_K.	0
uh to to exploit FrameNet	0

So you you guys never sent anybody  else  from I_ U.	0

Uh, this was supposedly an  exchange  program, and I we you know, it's  fine.  We don't  care,  but it just I'm a  little  surprised that	0
uh, Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send.	0
Uh  I don't know, I mean the uh -	0
Alright. I mean I had forgotten a- I To be honest with you, I'd  totally  forgotten we  had  a program.	0
Uh it's in the  program?	0
Uh I I think it's it's really the lack of students uh, at I_U at the moment.	0
Yeah. No, no. There was a whole co- There was a little contract signed. It was Yeah.	0
Yeah, yeah. I think it's ju- it's more the lack of of students,	0
really, and w- we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams. But -	0
Well I mean if if  I  were a student, I'd  love  to come  here,  rather than	0
work for some  German    company, or -	0
You  are  being recorded right now, so beware.	0
Well,  I  didn't say anybody to anything to offend well, except for the  sponsors  maybe, but -	0
Right. So I thi- tha- that's that's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you're here.	0

is  himself  out of town.	1
Well I'll go to the uh, Semantic Web Workshop, uh,	0
Yeah, for for some reason he's  not  doing that.	0
I don't know why he  @@  oh, I, who knows? Anyway, s- yeah, you'll see you'll certainly see a lot of the people there.	0
Well, he had other things to do.	0
The other person I  thought  of is Dan Gildea? because he did some work on topic	1
St- statistical stuff. That would be a very good idea.	0
which is, I mean, you I mean. I don't Depending on how well you wanna integrate with  that  end, you know, like, taking the data and fig- you said the learning systems that	0
figure out We There's someone in ICSI who actually has been working on -	1
has worked on that kinda stuff,  and  he's worked with frame net, so you could talk to him about, you know,  both  of those things at once. So.	1
And he just finished writing a draft of his thesis. So.	0
So, uh, who is that again?	0
I- u-  Dan Gildea, G_I_L_D_E_A.	0
And, he's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff, and -	0
I can take you to his office. It's just around the corner.	0
Well, if you fal-  solve  the  problem,   hope you can do one for us  too.	0
Alright, was there anything else for this?	0
One  of these times soon	0
we're gonna hear about  construal.	0
Yeah. I'm sure. I have um I think it was November two thousand three or some -	0
No. Wh- I had something in my calendar.	0
Wait  a second.  That's  a long way  away.	0
Uh well, maybe I can I can  bribe  my way out of this. So.	0
So  I  did some double checking and it seems like  spring  break in two thousand  one.  No.	0
Talk about changing the topic.	0
Well, no, but he's he's he's he's as you said, he's, like the state legislature, he's trying to offer us bribes.	0
At least this is a private meeting.	0
Right, exactly, O_K, that's the link.	0
Oh, they refused the budget again? Is it so about CITRIS? Yeah, still nothing.	1
Uh, this this this t- the s-  we're, uh, involved in a	0
literally three hundred million dollar	0
Uh, with the State of California. And, the State of California is now	0
a month and a half behind its legis- its legally required date to approve a budget.	0
So the budget has  not  been approved.	0
And  two  days ago -	0
There's two l- you know, so, two branches of legislature.  One  branch  approved  it,	0
yesterdayday   there was this uh uh I  thought  that the other branch would just approve it, but now there's actually a little  back  sliding to people who -	0
who approved it got flak from there, eh anyway. So,	0
Oh! I have to tell you a  wonderful  story about this, O_K?	0
And  then  we'll go.  So, I it turns out I wound up having lunch today	1
with a guy named Tom Kalil.	1
Berkeley. In fact he's hired to	1
run a lot of CITRIS, even though we don't have the money they -	1
So they've been  hiring  people right and left, so,	0
uh,  they  think the money's coming. So and he  was,  I think,	0
the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters.	0
He was in the White House, I don't  remember what he was saying . A- anyway,  like  that.	0
doing all the politics for CITRIS, but  also,  has a uh, a  lot  of interest in	0
uh, actually doing things for  society,  so digital  divide  and stuff like that. So that's	0
s- interesting to me but maybe not to you. But the  really  interesting thing was,	0
he st- he s- he s- said something about,	0
you know I'm interested in things that have high social multiplier, something that is of great social value. He said,	1
this was his  only  example,	1
adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor,	1
and as compelling as a video game,	1
then that would have a huge social impact".	1
I said, "Oh great! That's a good problem to work on."  Anyway.  So it was nice that	1
of A_, that's what you should try to do, and B_,	0
uh, language would be a good way to do it.	0
So anyway, that's the end of the story.	0
But for  adults  and not for the	0
This was Yeah. I didn't push him on the ch- on the child thing, but, uh,	0
you know, a- again, if if you if you	0
and this was this was  literacy,  which actually is somewhat different problem. Maybe easier. I don't know.	0
So this is  reading,  rather than teaching -	0
Another project we started on, and and didn't get funded for was,	0
uh, to try to build an automatic  tutoring  program,	0
whose first language wasn't  English.	0
Which is like half the school population in California.	0
Something  like that, isn't it?	0
and the idea was if we're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding, couldn't we build	0
be  tutors  for the  kids.	0
Anyway.  So so But this is a  slightly  different problem, and	0
I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right  now,  but it i- it's -	0
it's interesting and I may	0
um, talk to him some more about is em- somebody already doing this, and stuff like that.	0
So anyway, that was that was today's little story.	0
O_K. So I I  did  manage to	0
get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS, but uh or a-  temporarily  putting it out of the sling but, I I'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that	0
n- uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our  daily  meetings,	0
thanks for all the comments,	0
the c- the original construal proposal.	0
And, if I put one and one together, I may end up with a number that's greater than one and that I I can	0
potentially present once you get back.	0
Nnn.  s- sometimes, you know the sum is not uh less than the -	0
Anyway.  Yeah, so O_K, so that'd be great, but I'd -	0
Absolutely. Yeah. But um, and hopefully all sidetracking	0
things will have disappeared, soon.	0
