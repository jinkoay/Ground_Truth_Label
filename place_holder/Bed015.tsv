- what things to talk about.	0
I'm - What?	0
Really? Oh, that's  horrible!	0
Disincentive!	0
O_K, we're recording.	0
Hello? Hello? Which am I?	0
Check check  check check.	0
Uh, yeah.	0
Oh right.	0
Alright. Good.	0
Channel fi- O_K.	0
O_K.	0
Are you doing something? O_K, then I guess  I'm  doing something. So, um,	0
So basically the result of m- much thinking since the last time we met, um, but not as much writing, um, is a sheet that I have a lot of, like, thoughts and justification of comments on but I'll just pass out as is right now. So, um,	0
here.  If you could pass this around?	0
And there's two things. And so one on one side is - on one side is a sort of [MASK] And the other side is, um, sort	0
Um -	0
The - wait.	0
This is just one sheet, right?	0
Ah! Just one sheet. O_K.	0
It's just a - Nothing else. Um,	0
Front, back.	0
Enough to go around? O_K.	0
And in  some  ways it's - it's - it's  very  similar to - There are very few changes in some ways from what we've, um, uh, b- done before but I don't think everyone here has seen	0
all of this.	0
So, uh, I'm not sure where	0
to begin.	0
Um, as usual the disclaimers are there are - all these things are -	0
it's only  slightly  more stable than it was before.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And, um, after a little bit more	0
discussion and especially like Keith and I - I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days, um, it'll probably change again some more.	0
Yeah.	0
Um, maybe I will -	0
let's start b- let's start on number two actually on the notation, um, because that's,	0
I'm  thinking,  possibly a little more familiar to, um - to people.	0
O_K, so the  top  block is just sort of a - sort of abstract nota- it's sort of like, um,	1
listings of the kinds of things that we can have.	1
And certain things that have, um,	0
changed, have changed  back  to this.	0
There - there's been a little bit of, um, going back and forth. But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name. I forgot to include that you could have	0
a  type  included in this line. So something like, um - Well, there's an example - [MASK] So,	0
What I was gonna -	0
Right.	0
um, just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful LaTeX. It could be, you know, simple old text as well. Um, there are a couple of -	0
Uh, these three have  various  ways of doing certain things. So I'll just try to go through them. So they could all have a type at the beginning.	0
Um, and then they say [MASK] and they have some name.	0
Oh, I see. So - so the current syntax is if it s- if there's a type it's before construct- O_K, that's fine.	0
Yeah, right.	0
O_K, and then it has [MASK] And as usual I guess all the constructions her- all the examples here have only, um,	0
tsk	0
[MASK] I  think  that's actually gonna turn out to m- be  certainly  the most common kind.	0
But in general instead of the word " construct ", th- here you might have "meaning" or "form" as well.	0
O_K? So if there's some element that doesn't - that isn't  yet  [MASK] in the sense that it maps form and meaning.	0
O_K, um,	0
the  main  change with the  constructs  which - each of which has,	0
um, the key word "construct" and then some name,	0
and then some  type  specification, is that it's -	0
it's pro- it's often -  sometimes  the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is. So for example	0
whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word "throw", or it's gonna be a form of the word,	0
you know, I don't know, " happy ", or something like that. Or, you know, some- it'll be a specific word	0
or maybe you'll have the  type.  You'll say "I need [MASK] here" or "I	0
So-  uh  you could have a j- a actual type here.	0
Um, or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type. So a very common example of this is	0
that, you know, in directed motion, the first person to do something should be an  agent  of some kind, often a  human.  Right? So if I -	0
you know, the- um,	0
uh, run down the street then I -	0
I - I run down the street, it's typed, uh, "I", meaning  category  is what's there.	0
The - the  new  kind is this one that is sort of a  pair	0
and, um,	0
sort of skipping fonts and whatever. The idea is that sometimes there are, um,  general  constructions that you  know,  that you're going to need.	0
It's - it's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase, or something like that there. And usually it has formal	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um, considerations that will go along with it. And then	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh, you might know something much more  specific  depending on what construction you're talking about,	0
about what meaning - what  specific  meaning you want.	0
So the example again at the  bottom,  which is directed motion,	0
you might need [MASK] to take the place of, you know, um,	0
"the big th-", you- you know, "the big - the tall dark man", you know, "walked into the room". But	0
Mm-hmm.	0
because of the nature of this  particular  construction you know  not  just that [MASK] but in particular, that it's some kind	0
[MASK]	0
and  which will apply just as well to like, you know, a per- you know, a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression.	0
Um,	0
so I don't know if the syntax will hold but  something  that gives you a way to do  both  [MASK] So.	0
O_K, then I don't think the,  um -	0
at least - Yeah.  None of  these  examples have anything	0
different for formal constraints? But you can refer to	0
any of the, um,	0
sort of available elements  and  scope,	0
right? which here are the constructs,	0
to say something about the relation.	0
And I  think  i- if you not- if you compare like the top block and the textual block,	0
um, we dropped like [MASK]	0
Good.	0
And I think that, um, in general it'll be unambiguous. Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you're referring to [MASK] So - so by saying -	0
if I just said "Name  one " then that  means  name one  formal  and we're talking about formal struc-  Which - which makes sense. Uh, there are certain times when we'll have an  exception  to that, in which case you could just indicate	0
"here I mean the meaningful for some reason".	0
Right? Or - Actually it's more often that,	0
only  to handle this one special case of, you know, "George and Jerry walk into the room in that order". So we have a few funny things where	0
Mm-hmm.	0
something in the meaning might  refer  to something in the form.	0
But - but s- we're not gonna really worry about that for right now and there are way- We can be more specific if we  have  to later on.	0
O_K, and so	0
in terms of the - the relations, you know, as usual they're before and ends. I should have put an example in of something that isn't [MASK] but in form you might also have	0
[MASK] You know, you could say that, um,	0
you know, "name-one dot", t- you know, " number  equals", you know,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
a  plural  or something like that. There are certain things that are attribute-value, similar to the bindings below but I mean	0
they're just - us- usually they're going to be value -	0
value fillers, right?	0
O_K, and then again [MASK] There was talk of changing the name of that.	0
And Johno and I - I - you - you and I can like fight about that if you like? but about	0
changing it to [MASK] which I thought was a little bit too	0
Well -	0
order-biased and [MASK] which I thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have	0
Th-	0
only bindings. And so it was an issue whether constraints - um, there  were  some linguists who reacted against "constraints", saying, "oh, if it's not used for matching,	0
then it shouldn't be called a constraint". But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it's used for matching or not.	0
Right? Cuz there are - I think we thought of some situations where it  would  be useful to use whatever the c- bindings are, for	0
actual, you know, sort of like modified constraining purposes.	0
Well, you  definitely  want to de-couple the formalism from the parsing strategy.	0
Yeah.	0
So that whether or not	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
it's used for matching or only for verification, I -	0
It's used shouldn't matter, right?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
s- For  sure.  I mean, I don't know what, uh,  term  we want to use but we  don't  want to -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah, uh, there  was  one time when - when Hans explained why	0
"constraints" was a misleading word for  him.  And I  think  the reason that he gave was  similar  to the reason why  Johno  thought it was a misleading term, which was just an interesting coincidence. Um, but,	0
Yep.	0
uh - And so I was like, "O_K, well both of you don't like it? Fine, we can change it". But I - I - I'm starting to like it again.  So that- that's why -  That's why I'll stick with it. So -	0
It's g- it's gone.	0
But -	0
Well, you know what? If you have an "if-then" phrase, do you know what the "then" phrase is called?	0
Th-	0
What? Con- uh, a consequent?	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, but it's  not  an "if-then".	0
I know. Anyway, so the other - the other strategy you guys could consider is	0
No, but -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
when you don't know what word to put, you could put  no  word,	0
just  meaning.  O_K? And the- then let -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, that's true.	0
So that's why you put [MASK]	0
Oh, oops! No. That was just a mistake of cut and paste from when I was going with  it . So, I'm sorry. I didn't mean - that one's an in- unintentional.	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
So this should be semantic and -	0
Sometimes I'm intentionally inconsistent cuz I'm not sure yet. Here, I actually - it was just a mistake.	0
@@	0
Th- so this definitely should be [MASK] down at the bottom?	0
Sure.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
Well, unless I go with "meaning" but i- I mean, I kind of like "meaning" better than "semantic" but I think there's	0
Or -	0
Oh, whatever.	0
vestiges of other people's biases. Like -	0
Or - wh-	0
That- b- Right. Minor - min- problem - O_K.	0
Minor point. O_K, um,	0
Extremely.	0
so I think the  middle  block doesn't really give you  any  more information, ex- than the top block. And the bottom block	1
similarly only just illus- you know, all it does is illustrate  that  you can drop the subscripts  and  -	0
and  that you can drop the, um - uh, that you can give dual types. Oh, one thing I should mention is about "designates". I think I'm actually	1
inconsistent across these as  well.  So, um, strike out the M_ subscript on the middle block. So basically  now,  um, this is actually -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
this little change actually goes along with a  big  linguistic	0
change, which is that "designates" isn't	0
only  something for the semantics to worry about now.	0
Good.	0
So we want s- "designates" to actually  know  one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects	0
but is sort of, um,  really  important for say composition later on.	1
So for instance, if some other construction says,	0
you know, "are you of type - is this part of type whatever", um, the "designates" tells you which sort of part is the meaning part. O_K, so if you have like "the big red ball",	1
you know, you wanna know if there's an object or a noun. Well,  ball  is going to be the designated	0
sort of element of that kind of phrase. Um,	0
Mmm.	0
there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about  form  it's useful sometimes to talk about, um -	0
to talk about there also being a designated  object  and we think that that'll be the same one, right? So the ball is the head	0
of the phrase, "the r- the -", um, "big red ball", and the  entity  denoted by the word "ball" is sort of [MASK] in some ways of - of this sort of, um,	1
in- interesting larger element.	0
A- a- and the - Yeah. And there's - uh there's ca- some cases where the grammar depends on [MASK]  And - and this enables you to  get  that, if I  understand  you right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah. That's the idea. Yeah.	0
Right, right.	1
Yeah yeah.	0
And, uh, you might be able to say things like if the head has to go  last  in [MASK] you can refer to the  head  as a p- the, you know -	0
having to be at the end of that  decision . So that's a useful thing so that you can get some internal structural constraints in.	1
Right.	0
O_K, so that all looks good. Let me -	0
Oh, w- Oh. I don't know. Were you finished?	0
Um, there was a list of things that isn't included but you - you can - you can ask a question. That might	0
O_K. So, i- if I  understand  this	0
@@  it.	0
the - aside from, uh, construed and all that sort of stuff, the - the differences are mainly that,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
we've gone to the possibility of having [MASK] for a  type	0
or actually gone  back  to, if we go back far enough -	0
Right.	0
Well, except for [MASK] so it's not clear that,	0
uh -	1
Well, right now it's a c- uh contr- [MASK] So I don't know what a form	1
Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry, you're right. [MASK]	0
type is. Yeah.	1
Uh, that's fine. But it, um -	0
Right.	0
A- well, and a previous, um, you know, version of the notation  certainly  allowed you to single out the meaning	0
bit by it. So you could say "construct of type whatever designates  something ".	0
Yeah.	0
But that was  mostly  for  reference  purposes, just to refer to [MASK] . I don't think that	0
it was often used to give an extra meaning const-  type  constraint on the meaning, which is  really  what we want most of the time I  think.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um,	0
I - I don't know if we'll ever have a case where we actually h- if there  is  [MASK] you could imagine having a triple there that says, you know - that's kind of weird.	0
No, no, no, I don't think so. I think that you'll - you'll do  fine.  In  fact,	0
I -	0
these are, um,	0
as long as - as Mark isn't around, these  are  [MASK] So [MASK] is - uh, the  fact  that it's  animate,	0
is semantic. The fact that it's n- uh, [MASK] I would say on most people's notion of - of f- you know,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Right, right.	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
Which is fine, yeah.	0
It's - that now, um, I'm mentioned this, I - I don't know if I ever explained this but the point of, um,	0
Yeah.	0
I mentioned in the  last  meeting,	0
the point of having something called [MASK] is, um,	0
because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for, you know, like say taking as its object	0
just  some expression which, um, designates an object or designates a thing, or whatever, um,	0
that  leads to some syntactic problems basically? So you wanna, you know - you sort of have this problem like	0
"O_K, well, I'll put the word",	0
uh, let's say, the word " dog ",	0
you know. And that has to come right after the verb cuz we know verb meets its object.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And then we have a construction that says, oh, you can have "the" preceding a noun. And so you'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet	0
Right.	0
the designatum. And you could get, you know, "the kicked dog" or something like that, meaning "kicked the dog".	0
Right.	0
Um, so you kind of have to let this phrase idea  in  there but -	0
That I - I have no problem with it at all. I think it's  fine.	0
It- it- Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Right, n- s-	0
you may be - you may not be like everyone else in - in  Berkeley,  but that's O_K. Uh, we don't mind  either,  so -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
I mean, we - we - we sort of thought we were getting away with, uh - with, a p- I mean, this is not reverting to [MASK] But, uh,	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
I just know that this is - Like, we didn't originally have in mind that, uh - that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form. Um,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
But they do.	1
Well, there's an alternative to  this  which is, um - The question was did we want directed motion,	0
but they does.	0
At least in English.	0
Yeah.	0
which is [MASK] -	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
did we want  it  to  worry  about, um, anything more than the fact that it, you know, has semantic - You know, it's sort of [MASK] So one  option   that, you know, Keith had mentioned also was like,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject, predicate, basically things like grammatical relations,	1
those could intersect with these in such a way that subject, predicate, or subject, predicate, subject,	1
verb, ob- you know, verb object would require that  those  things that f- fill a subject and object are [MASK]	1
Right.	0
And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way. But you know, for  now,  I mean,	0
Yeah. But it - y- y- it's - yeah, just moving it - moving the c- the cons- the constraints around. O_K, so that's -	0
uh, you know.	0
M- moving it to another place, right.	0
Yeah.	0
But there  does  - basically, the point is there  has  to be that constraint  somewhere,  right? So, yeah.	0
Right.	0
And so that was the -	0
Robert's not happy now?	0
No!	0
Oh, O_K.	0
O_K, and sort of going  with  that is that the designatum also now is a  pair.	0
Yes.	0
Instead of just the meaning. And that aside from some terminology,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
that's basically  it.	0
Right.	0
I just want to b- I'm - I'm  asking.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yep.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, um, the	0
un- sort of the un-addressed questions in this, um, definitely would for instance be semantic constraints we talked about.	0
Yeah.	0
Here are just bindings but,	0
right?  we might want to introduce [MASK] -  You know, there's all these things that we don't -	0
The whole - [MASK] is clearly not here.	1
Right? So there's going to be some extra - you know, definitely other notation we'll need for that which we skip for now.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
By the way, I  do  want to get  on  that as soon as Robert gets  back.  So, uh, the - [MASK] Um, obviously,	0
Uh	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
[MASK] is a b- is a b- is a big  component  of that so this probably not worth trying to do anything  till  he gets back. But sort of as  soon  as he gets back I think	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um, we ought to -	0
So what's the - what's the time frame? I forgot again when  you're going away for	0
how long?	0
Just, uh, as a - sort of a mental bridge, I'm not - I'm skipping fourth of July.	0
O_K.	0
So, uh,  right afterwards I'm back.	0
O_K.	0
What?  You're missing like the  premier   American holiday? What's the point of spending a year here? So, anyway.	0
Uh, I've had it often enough.	0
Well he w- he went to  college  here.	0
Oh, yeah, I forgot. Oops.  Sorry.  O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
And  furthermore  it's well worth  missing.	0
Not in  California.	0
Yeah, that's true. I like - I -	0
Yes.	0
I  like  spending fourth of July in other countries,  whenever I can.	0
Right.	0
Um -	0
O_K, so that's great.	0
[MASK] O_K, so -	0
Oh,  so there  was  one question that came out.	0
I  hate  this thing. Sorry.	1
Um, which is,	0
so something like " past " which i- you know, we think is a very	1
simple - uh, we've often just stuck it in as a  feature,  you know, "oh,	1
Right.	0
Right.	0
this event takes place before speech time",  O_K, is what this means.	0
Um, it's often thought of as -	1
it is also considered [MASK]  you know, by, you know, lots of people  around  here. So	1
Right.	0
Right.	0
there's this issue of well sometimes there are really exotic explicit [MASK] that say "in France, blah-blah-blah", and you have to build up - you ha- you would imagine that would require you, you know, to be very specific about the machinery,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
whereas  past  is a very conventionalized one and we sort of  know  what it means	1
but it - we doesn't - don't necessarily want to, you know, unload all the notation every time we see	0
that it's past tense. So, you know, we could think of our - uh, just like [MASK] "walk" refers to this complicated structure,	0
Right.	0
I think that's exactly right.	0
past  refers to, you know, a certain configuration of this thing with respect to it. So -	0
so we're kind of like having our cake and eating it - you know, having it both ways, right? So, i- i-	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.  No, I think - I think that i- we'll have to  see  how it works out when we do the  details  but	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
my intuition would be that that's right.	0
Yeah, O_K.	0
Do you want to do the same for  space?	1
Wha- sorry?	0
Space?	0
Space?	0
Here?	0
Now?	0
Oh, oh, oh, oh, instead of just  time?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same thing. So there are very conventionalized like	1
Mm-hmm.	0
deictic ones, right?	1
And then I think for  other  spaces that you  introduce,	0
you could just attach y- whatever - You could build up an appropriately - uh, appropriate structure according to the l- the sentence.	0
Hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Hmm, well this - this basically would involve everything you  can  imagine to fit under your C_ dot something -	0
N-	0
Yeah. Right. Mm-hmm.	1
you know, where - where it's contextually dependent, "what is now, what was past, what is in the future, where is this, what is here, what is there, what is -"	0
Mm-hmm. Yeah. So time and space. Um, we'll - we'll get that on the other side a  little,  like very minimally. There's a sort of- there's a slot for setting time and setting place. And	0
Good.	0
you know, you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place, and then there are many in- more interestingly, linguistically anyway,  there are relative things that, you know, you relate	0
the event in time and space to where you are now.	0
If there's something a lot more  complicated  like, or so - hypothetical or whatever, then you have to do  your  job, like or  somebody's  job anyway. I'm gonna point to - at random.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm - I'm s- curious about how much of	0
the mental - I mean, I'm not sure that	1
the  formalism,  sort of the  grammatical  side of things,  is gonna have that much going on in terms of [MASK]	1
You know, um, basically	1
all of [MASK] that are in the sentence are going to sort of - I think of it as, sort of giving you the coordinates of, you know -	1
assuming that at any point in discourse there's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different	1
world scenarios, whatever, and the speaker's supposed to be keeping track of those.	0
The, um - the construction that you actually get is just gonna sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you've already got going,	0
Mm-hmm.	1
um, you're supposed to add structure to. So "in France, uh, Watergate wouldn't have hurt Nixon" or something like that.	1
Um, well, you say, "alright, I'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past France universe" or something like that. The information in the sentence tells you  that  much but it doesn't tell you	1
like exactly what it - what the point of  doing  so  is.  So for example, depending on the linguistic con- uh, context it could be -	1
like the question is for example, what does "Watergate" refer to there?	0
Does it, you know - does it refer to, um - if you just hear that sentence  cold,  the assumption is that when you say "Watergate" you're referring to "a Watergate-like scandal as we might imagine it happening in France".	0
But in a different context, "oh, you know, if Nixon had apologized right away it wouldn't - you know, Watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the U_S and in France it wouldn't have hurt him at all".	0
Now we're s- now that "Watergate" -	0
we're now talking about the  real  one, and the "would"	0
They're real, right.	0
sort of - it's a sort of different dimension of hypothe-theticality, right? We're not saying -	0
I see - right.	0
What's hypothetical about this world. In the first case, hypothetically we're imagining that Watergate happened in France. In the second case we're imagining hypothetically that Nixon had apologized right away	0
Hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
or something. Right? So a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level. Uh, um, and so -	0
Correct.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I don't know where that sits then, sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant.	0
Hmm.	0
It seems like, um, the grammatical things such as [MASK] that you know introduce these conditionals, whatever,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
give you sort of the - the most basi- th- those we - I think we can figure out what the possibilities are, right? There are sort of a relatively limited number. And then	0
Mm-hmm.	0
how they interact with some extra thing like "in France" or "if such-and-such",	0
Yeah.	0
that's like there are certain ways that they c- they can - You know, one is a more specific version	0
of the general pattern that the grammat- grammar gives you.  I think . But, you know, whatever, we - we're -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, in the  short  run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going. Uh, I - uh, you - you -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
But the whole point of - the whole point of what Fauconnier and Turner have to say about, uh, [MASK] and all that stuff is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence. You know,	0
there's not that much information contained in the sentence. It just says, "Here. Add this structure to this space." and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite	0
open. An individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on, quote, [MASK]	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And so somebody's gonna have to be doing a whole lot of work but not  me,  I think.	0
Well -	0
I think that's right.	0
Oh, I - yeah, I, uh, uh - I think that's -	0
Not k- I th-	0
I don't think it's completely  right.  I mean, in fact a sentence- examples you gave in f- did constrain the meaning b- the form  did  constrain the meaning,	0
Yeah.	0
and so, um, it isn't, uh -	0
Sure, but like what - what was the point of saying that sentence about Nixon and France? That is not - there is nothing about that in the - in the sentence really.	0
That's O_K. We usually don't know the point of	0
Yeah.	0
the sentence at all. But we know what it's trying to say. We - we know that it's - what predication it's setting up. That's all.	0
Y- yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
But - but - bottom line, I agree with you, that - that - that we're not expecting much out of the, uh f-	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
[MASK] right? So.	0
uh, [MASK] yeah.	1
Mmm.	0
And, um - I mean, you're -  you're  the  linguist  but, uh, it seems to me that th- these - we - we - you know, we've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something. Yeah, I mean -	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
Yeah. Oh, yeah.	0
uh, I - I mean, that - that's my  feeling  that - that these are really hard	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
uh, problems that decide exactly what - what's going on.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
O_K, so, um,  one  other thing I just want to point out is	1
there's a lot of confusion about the terms like	0
"profile, designate, focus", et cetera, et cetera.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh, right, right, right.	0
Um, for  now  I'm gonna say like "profile"'s often used - like two uses that come to mind immediately.	1
One is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else. So "hypotenuse", you profiled this guy against the background of the  right t- right triangle. O_K.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And the  second  use, um, is in [MASK] It's slightly different. Oh, I was asking Hans about this. They use it to really mean,	1
um, this - in a frame th- this is - the profiles on the - these are the ones that are  required.  So they have to be	1
there  or  expressed  in some way. Which - which -	0
I'm not saying one and two are mutually  exclusive  but they're - they're different  meanings.  So the closest thing - so I was thinking about how it relates to this notation.	0
Right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
For  us,  um -	0
O_K, so how is it - so " designate " -	0
Does that - Is that really what they mean in - in -	0
[MASK]	0
[MASK] I didn't  know  that.	0
Yeah, yeah. I - I mean, I - I was a little bit surprised about it too. I knew that -	0
Yeah.	0
I thought that that would be something like -	0
there's another term that I've heard for  that  thing but they - I mean - uh, well, at least  Hans  says they use it that way. And -	0
Right, O_K.	0
Well, I'll check.	0
and may- maybe he's wrong. Anyway, so	0
I think the - the	1
"designate" that we have in terms of  meaning	0
is really the "highlight this thing with respect to everything else". O_K? So this is what - what it means.	1
Right.	0
But the  second  one seems to be useful but we might not need a notation for it? We don't have a notation for it	1
but we might want one. So for example we've talked about	0
if you're talking about the lexical item "walk", you know it's an action. Well, it  also  has	0
this idea - it carries along with it the idea of an actor or somebody's gonna do the walking. Or if you talk about an adjective "red", it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red.	0
So  we  used to use the notation "with"	0
for this and I think that's closest to their second one. So I d- don't yet know, I have no commitment, as to whether we  need  it. It might be -	1
Right.	0
it's the kind of thing that w- a parser might want to  think  about whether we  require  - you know, these things are like it's  semantically  part of it -	0
N- no, no. Well, uh, th-  critically  they're  not  required syntactically. Often they're pres- presu- presupposed and all that sort of stuff.	0
Right.	0
Right, right. Yeah, um, definitely. So, um,	0
"in" was a good example. If you walk "in", like well,	0
in  what?  You know, like you have to have the -  So - so it's only semantically is it - it is still required, say, by simulation time though to have	0
Right, there's -	0
Right.	0
something. So it's that - I meant the idea of like that -	0
[MASK] I don't know if that's something we need to spa- to - to like	0
say ever as part of the  requirement?  - or the  construction?   or  not.  We'll - we'll again defer.	0
Or - I mean, or - or, uh so the -	0
[MASK] is that the idea?  Just point at Robert. Whenever I'm confused just point to him.  You  tell me. O_K.	1
Yeah, yeah.	0
Right. It's - it's  his  thesis, right?  Anyway,	0
right, yeah, w- this is gonna be a b- you're right, this is a bit of in a mess and we still have emphasis as  well,  or  stress,  or whatever.	1
O_K, well we'll get, uh uh, I - we have thoughts about those as  well.  Um,	0
Yeah.	0
Great.	0
the- I w- I would just- s-  some  of this is just like	0
my - you know, by fiat. I'm going to say, this is how  we  use these terms. I don't- you know, there's  lots  of different ways in the world that people use it.	0
Yeah.	0
I - that's fine.	0
I think that, um, the other terms that are related are like focus and stress. So, s-	1
Mm-hmm.	0
I think that the way I -  we  would like to think, uh, I think is focus is something that comes up in, I mean, lots of -	0
basically this is the information structure. O_K, it's like - uh, it's not - it  might  be that there's a syntactic,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
uh,  device  that you use to indicate focus or that there are things like, you know, I think Keith was telling me,  things toward the  end  of the sentence, post-verbal, tend to be the focused -	1
focused element, the  new  information. You know, if I - "I walked into the room", you -	0
Mmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
tend to think that, whatever, "into the room" is sort of like the more focused kind of thing. And when you, uh,	0
Yeah.	0
uh, you have  stress  on something that might be, you know, a  cue  that the stressed element, or for instance, the  negated  element	0
is kind of related to information structure. So that's like the new -	0
the sort of like  import  or whatever of - of this thing. Uh, so - so I  think  that's kind of nice to keep "focus" being an information structure term.	1
" Stress " - I th- and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it. So, um,	0
like "stress", th- stress is kind of a pun on - you might have like - whatever, like, um,  accent  kind of stress. And that's just a -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh, w- we'll want to distinguish stress as a  form  device. You know, like, oh, high volume or whatever. Um,	1
Yeah.	0
t- uh, and distinguish that from it's  effect  which is, "Oh, the kind of focus we have is we're emphasizing this value	0
often  as opposed to other values", right? So focus carries along a scope. Like if you're gonna  focus  on this thing and you wanna know -	1
it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it  wasn't.  Um, so my classic -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
my now-classic example of saying, "Oh, he  did  go to the meeting?", that was my way of saying - as opposed to, you know, "Oh, he  didn't  g-" or "There  was  a meeting?" I think that was the example that was	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
caught on by the linguists immediately. And so, um, the - like if you said he - you know, there's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you're,	0
c-	0
focusing, whatever, on, uh - "he  walked  to the meeting" as opposed to "he  ran ", or "he  did  walk to the meeting" as opposed to "he  didn't  walk". You know, so	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
we need to have a notation for that which, um, I think that's still in progress. So, sort of I'm still working it out.	1
But it did - one - one implication it does f- have for the other side, which we'll get to in a minute is that	1
I  couldn't  think of a good way to say "here are the  possible  things that you could focus on", cuz it seems like any entity	1
in any sentence, you know, or any meaning component of anyth- you know - all the possible meanings you could have,  any  of them could be the subject of focus.	1
Mmm.	0
But I think one - the one thing you  can  schematize is the  kind  of focus, right? So for instance, you could say it's	0
the - the  tense  on this as opposed to, um, the - the  action.  O_K. Or it's - uh, it's an  identity  thing or a  contrast  with other things,	0
or stress this value as opposed to other things. So, um,	0
it's - it  is  kind of like a profile - profile-background	0
thing but I - I can't think of like the limited set of	1
possible meanings that you would - that you would focu- light - highlight	1
Light up with focus, yeah.	1
as opposed to other ones. So it has some certain complications for the, uh, uh -	0
later on. Li- I mean, uh, the best thing I can come up with is that information has a list of focused  elements.	1
For instance, you - Oh, one other type that I forgot to mention is like  query  elements and that's probably relevant for the like "where is",	1
you know, "the castle" kind of thing? Because you might want to say that, um,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
location or cert- certain W_H words bring - you know, sort of automatically focus in a, you know, "I don't know the identity of this thing" kind of way on certain elements. So.	0
O_K.  Anyway.  So that's onl- there are - there are  many  more things that are uncl- that are sort of like a  little  bit unstable about the notation but it's most - I think it's - this is,	0
you know, the current - current form. Other things we didn't	1
totally deal with, um,	0
well, we've had a lot of other stuff that Keith and I have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective. You know, a - [MASK] And, um,	1
Oh, there's a bunch.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
I mean, we should have put an example of this and we could do that later. But I think the not- inherently like the general principles still work though, that,	0
Yeah.	0
um, we can have [MASK] in that there is like, you know, for instance, one -	0
Uh, you know, they - they have [MASK]	0
right? So you can like nest things when you need to,	1
but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way.	1
So if you don't have like a lot of grammar experience, then like this - this might, you know, be a little o- opaque. But, you know, we have the	1
properties of [MASK] and some properties of constituents -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Good.	0
O_K.	0
I can say two things about the f-	0
Yes.	0
Maybe you want to forget stress.	1
This - my f-	0
As a word?	0
No, as - as - Just don't - don't think about it. If -	0
As a -	0
What's  that?  Sorry.	0
canonically  speaking you can - if you look at a - a curve over sentence, you can	1
find out where a certain stress is and say, "hey, that's my focus  exponent. "	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
It doesn't tell you  anything  what the  focus  is. If it's  just  that thing,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Or [MASK] that it falls in.	0
a little bit  more  or the whole  phrase.  Um -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
You mean t- forget about stress, the  form	0
The form bit because, uh, as a form cue, um, not even trained experts can always - well, they can tell you where the focus  exponent  is  sometimes.	1
Yeah.	0
cue? O_K.	0
And that's also mostly true for read speech. In - in  real  speech, um, people may put stress. It's  so  d- context dependent on what was there before, phrase ba- breaks, um, restarts. It's just, um -	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
it's absurd.	0
O_K, I believe you, yeah.	0
It's complicated. And all -	0
Yeah, I mean, I - I'm sort of inclined to say let's worry about specifying	0
the information structure  focus  of the sentence and then,	0
Mm-hmm. Ways that you can get it come from th- right.	0
hhh,  [MASK] can handle actually assigning	0
Or - or map  from  the contour to - to what the focus  exponent  is.	0
y- Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Exactly. But figure out how the -	0
Yeah.	0
But, uh, if you don't know what you're - what you're focus is then you're - you're  hopeless-uh-ly   lost anyways,	0
Right.	0
That's fine, yeah. Mm-hmm.	0
and the  only  way of figuring out what  that  is,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
is, um, by sort of generating all the possible  alternatives  to each focused element, decide which one in that context makes sense and which one  doesn't.	1
And then you're left with a couple three.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So, you know, again, that's something that h-  humans  can do, um, but far outside the scope of - of any -	0
anything.  So.	0
You know.	0
It's -	0
O_K. Well, uh, yeah, I  wouldn't  have assumed that it's an easy problem in - in absence of all the oth- you need all the other information I guess.	0
u- u-	0
But it's - it's - what it - uh, it's  pretty  easy to put it in the  formalism,  though. I mean, because	0
Yeah.	0
you can just say whatever stuff, "i- is the container being focused or the - the entire whatever, both, and so forth."	0
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah. Exactly. So the sort of  effect  of it is something we  want  to be able to capture.	0
Yeah, so b- b- but I think the poi- I'm not sure I understand but here's what I th- think is going on. That	0
if we do the constructions right when a particular construction  matches,	0
it - the fact that  it  matches,  does  in fact specify the focus.	0
W- uh,	0
I'm  not  sure about that. Or it might limit - it cert- certainly constrains	0
O_K.	0
Uh - k- uh, at- at the very least it constrai-	0
the  possibilities  of focus. I think that's - that's, th- that's  certainly  true. And depending on the construction it may or may not f- specify the focus, right?	0
Oh, uh, for sure, yes. There are constrai- yeah, it's not every - but there are constructions, uh, where you t- explicitly take into account those considerations	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
that you  need  to take into account in order to decide which - what is being focused.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So we talked about that a little bit this morning.	0
" John  is on the bus, not Nancy." So that's - focuses on John. "John is on the  bus  and not on the train." "John is on the  bus " versus "John is on the train." And "John  is  on the bus" versus "was", and e-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
Hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
Is on. "John is on  the  bus". Yeah. Yeah.	0
Right.	0
"it's  the  bu-" so e-	0
Yeah, all - all of those. Yeah.	0
Right.	0
All of these and will we have - u- is it all the same constructions? Just with [MASK]	0
Yeah, I would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of, I don't know -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
the fact that you can get it  without  any stress and you have some - whatever is predicated anyway	1
should be the same set of constructions. So that's why I was talking about overlapping constructions. So, then you have a separate thing that picks out, you know, stress on something relative to everything else.	1
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So, the question is actually - oh, I'm sorry, go ahead, finish.	0
And it would - yeah, and it w- and that would have to - uh it might be ambiguous as, uh, whether it picks up  that  element, or the  phrase,  or something like that. But it's  still  is limited possibility.	1
Hmm.	0
So that should, you know, interact with - it should overlap with whatever other construction is there.	0
Yeah.	0
S- s- the  question  is, do we have a way on the  other  page, uh, when we get to the s- semantic side, of saying what the stressed element was, or stressed phrase, or something.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Well, so that's why I was saying how - since I couldn't think of an  easy  like  limited  way of doing it, um, all I can say is that information structure has a focused slot and I think that should be able to refer to -	1
Right.	0
So that's down at the bottom here when we get over there. O_K.	0
Yeah, and, infer - and I don't have - I don't have a great way or great examples but I think that - something like that is probably gonna be, uh, more - more what we have to do. But, um, O_K, that was one comment. And you had another one?	0
I'll- I'll wait.	0
O_K.	0
Hmm.	0
O_K.	0
So	0
Yeah, well the - once you know what the focus is the - everything else is background. How about [MASK] that's the other side of informat	1
How about what?	0
Yeah, so that was the other thing. And so I didn't realize it before. It's like, "oh!" It was an epiphany that it - you know, topic and focus are a  contrast  set. So topic is -	0
Topic-focused  seems to me like, um, background profile, O_K, or [MASK] or some- something like that. There's - there's definitely, um,	0
Mmm.	0
that kind of thing going on. Now I don't know whether -	0
I n- I don't have as many great examples of like [MASK]	0
on like focus, right? Um, topic - it seems kind of - you know, I think that might be an ongoing kind of thing.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Japanese has this though. You know. Yeah, that's what "wa" is, uh, just to mark which thing is the topic. It doesn't always have to be the subject.	0
[MASK]	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
So again, information structure has a topic slot. And, you know, I stuck it in thinking that we might use it. Um, I  think  I stuck it in. Um, and	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Yep, it's there.	0
one thing that I didn't do  consistently,  um, is - when we get there, is like indicate what  kind  of thing fits into every role. I think I have an idea of what it  should  be but th-	1
you know, so far we've been getting away with like either a  type  constraint or, um, you know, whatever. I forg- it'll be a  frame.  You know, it'll be - it'll be another predication or it'll be,	1
um, I don't know, some value from - from some- something, some variable and scope or something like that,	1
or a slot chain based on a variable and scope. O_K, so well that's - should we flip over to the other side officially then? I keep, uh, like, pointing forward to it. Yeah. Now we'll go back to s-  O_K, so this	1
Mm-hmm, hmm.	0
O_K, side one.	1
doesn't  include something which mi- mi- may have some effect on - on it, which is, um, [MASK]	0
record, right? So I didn't - I - I meant just like draw a line and like, you know, you also have,	0
uh, some tracking of what was going on. And sort of - this is a big scale comment before I, you know, look into the details of this. But for instance you could imagine instead of having -	0
Right.	0
I - I changed the name of - um it used to be "entities". So you see it's "scenario",	1
[MASK] And "scenario" is essentially what kind of - what's the basic predication, what event happened. And actually it's just a list of various slots	1
from which you would draw - draw in order to paint your picture, a bunch of frames, bi- and bindings, right?	1
Um, and obviously there are other ones that are not included here, general cultural frames and general like, uh, other action f- you know, [MASK] O_K, whatever.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
The  middle  thing used to be "entities" because you could imagine it should be like really a  list  where  here  was various  information.  And this is intended to be	1
grammatically  specifiable information about [MASK] - uh, you know, about some entity that you were going to talk about. So "Harry walked into the room",	1
"Harry" and "room", you know, the room - th- but they would be represented in this list somehow.	0
And it could  also  have for instance, it has this  category  slot.	0
Um, it should be either category or in-  or  instance. Basically, it  could  be [MASK] So that everything you know about this could be - could be drawn in. But the important things for	1
grammatical purposes are for - things like number, gender, um - ki- the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that, um, you need to figure out wheth- if it's a group whether, um, some event is happening,	0
linear time, linear spaces, like, you know, are - are they doing something serially or is it like,	0
um, uh I'm - I'm not sure. Because this  partly  came from, uh, Talmy's schema and I'm not sure we'll need all of these actually. But -	1
Um, and then the "status" I used was like, again, in some languages, you know, like for instance in child language you might distinguish between	0
different status. So, th- the - the big com- and - and finally [MASK] is about	1
sort of speech-act-y information structure-y, like [MASK]	1
So the comment I was going to make about, um, changing entity - the entity's block to reference is that  you can imagine your discourse like situation context, you  have  a set of entities that you're sort of referring to. And you might -  that  might be sort of a general,	0
I don't know, database of all the things in this discourse that you could  refer  to.	0
And I changed to "reference" cuz I would say, for a particular utterance you have particular	0
referring expressions in it. And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here. For instance, I know it's going to be plural. I know it's gonna be	0
feminine or something like that. And - and	0
these  could actually just  point  to, you know, the - the I_D in my  other  list of enti- active entities, right? So, um,	0
uh, th- there's - there's all this stuff about [MASK] We've talked about.	0
I almost listed [MASK] as a slot where you could say	0
it's active. You know, there's this, um, hierarchy - uh there's a schematization of, you know, things can be active or they can be,	0
um, accessible, inaccessible. It was the one that, you know, Keith, um, emailed to us once, to  some  of us, not  all  of us. And	0
Yeah.	0
the thing is that  that  - I noticed that that, um, list was sort of	0
discourse  dependent. It was like in this  particular  set, s- you know, instance, it  has  been referred to recently or it  hasn't  been, or this is something that's like in my world knowledge but not  active.  So.	1
Yeah.	0
This -	0
Uh - yeah, well there - there seems to be  context  properties. Yeah.	0
Yeah, they're contex- and for instance, I used to have a location thing there but actually	0
that's a property of the situation. And it's again, time, you know - at cert- certain points things are located, you know, near or far from you and -	0
Well, uh, uh, this is recursive cuz until we do the	0
Yeah.	0
uh, [MASK]	0
story, we're not quite sure -  Th- th- which is fine. We'll just - we'll j-	0
Yeah, yeah. So some of these are, uh -	0
we just don't  know  yet.	0
Right.	0
So  I - so for  now  I thought, well maybe I'll  just  have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance, right? Everything else here is utterance-specific.	0
Um, and I left the slot, "predications", open because you can have, um, things like "the guy I know from school". Or, you know, like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na- amounts of prep- you know, predications that you  might  make. And it's	0
Mm-hmm.	0
unclear whether - I mean, you could just have in your scenario, "here are some extra few things that are true", right?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And then you could just sort of not have this slot here. Right? You're - but -	0
but it's used for identification purposes. So it's - it's a little bit different from just saying "all these things are true from my utterance".	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Um.	0
Right, "this guy I know from school came for dinner" does  not  mean, um, "there's a guy, I know him from school, and he came over for dinner". That's not the same effect.	0
Yeah, it's a little bit - it's a little bit different. Right? So -  Or maybe that's like a restrictive, non-restrictive - you know, it's like it gets into that kind of thing for -	0
Yeah.	0
um, but maybe I'm mixing, you know - this is kind of like the final result after parsing the  sentence.  So you might imagine that	0
Mm-hmm.	0
the information you pass to, you know - in  identifying  [MASK] would be, "oh, some -" you know, "it's a guy and it's someone I know from school". So maybe that would,	0
Yeah.	0
you know, be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc- to the, whatever, [MASK] or whatever,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
you know, so - so you could imagine that this might not -  So, uh, I'm  uncommitted  to a couple of these things. Um.	0
But - to make it m- precise at least in  my  mind, uh, it's not precise. So "house" is gender neuter?	0
Um, it could be in -	0
In  reality  or in -	0
Semantically.	0
semantically,  yeah. Yeah. So it uh, uh, a table.	0
semantically.  So -	0
You know, a  thing  that c- doesn't have a gender. So. Uh, it could be that - I mean,	0
maybe you'd - maybe not all these - I mean, I wou- I would say that I tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most -  most  things.	0
No, just to make sure that we - everybody that's - completely agreed that it - it has nothing to do with, uh, form.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K, that is semantic as opposed to - Yeah. Yeah. That's right.	0
Um.	0
S- so again -	0
Then " predications " makes sense to - to have it open for something like, uh, accessibility or not.  Yeah.	0
Open to various things.	0
Right.	0
O_K, so. Let's see. So maybe having made that big sca- sort of like large scale comment, should I just go through each of these slots - uh, each of these blocks, um, a little bit?	1
Sure.	0
Um, mostly the top one is sort of [MASK] And just a	1
note, which was that, um - s- so when we actually ha- so for instance, um,	0
some of them seem more inherently static, O_K, like a container or sort of support-ish.	1
And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like "source, path, goal" is often thought of that way or "force", or something like that.	1
But in actual fact, I  think  that they're intended to be sort of  neutral  with respect to that. And different [MASK]  use  them	0
in a way that's either static or dynamic. So "path", you could just be talking about the path between this and this. And you know, "container" that you can go in and out. All of these things. And so, um,	0
Mmm.	0
I think this came up when, uh, Ben and I were working with the Spaniards, um, the other day - the "Spaniettes", as we  called them - um,	0
to decide like how you want to split up, like, s- [MASK] How do you link them up. And I think again, um,	1
it's gonna be something in [MASK] that tells you "is this static or is this dynamic". So we definitely need - that sort	1
that, you know, is it, uh, a state or is it a change of state, or is it a, um, action of some kind? Uh. Yeah.	0
Uh, i- i- i- is there any meaning to when you  have  sort of parameters behind it and when you  don't?  Just means -	0
Oh, oh! You mean, in the  slot?	0
Um, no, it's like X_sc- it's - it's like I was thinking of  type  constraints but [MASK] well it obviously has to b	0
Mm-hmm.	0
"Agent", I mean, the - the  performer  of [MASK] that s- depends	0
So the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were.	0
Yeah, basically.	0
O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um, "aspectual type" probably isn't obvious but I should have - So, I just neglected to stick something in. "Perspective", "actor", "undergoer", "observer", um,	0
Mmm.	0
I think we've often used "agent", "patient", obser- Yeah, exactly.  Exactly. Um, and so one nice thing that, uh,	0
"Whee!"  That's  that  one, right?	0
we had talked about is this example  of like, if you have [MASK] then one thing it does is ch- you know - definitely, it is one way to - for you to,	0
you know, specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object. And so then we talked about, you know, whether	0
well, does that specify topic as well? Well, maybe there are other things. You know, now that it's - subject is more like a topic. And now that, you know -	0
Anyway.  So. Sorry. I'm gonna trail off on that one cuz it's not that f- important right now.  Um,	0
N- now, for the moment we just need the ability to l- l- write it down if - if somebody figured  out  what the rules were. Yeah.	0
To know how -	0
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Um,	0
some of these other ones, let's see. So,	0
uh, one thing I'm uncertain about is [MASK] So polarity, uh, is using for like	1
Mm-hmm.	0
action did  not  take place for instance. So by default it'll be like "true", I guess, you know, if you're specifying events that  did  happen.	1
You could imagine that you skip out this - you know, leave off this polarity, you know, not - don't have it here. And then have it part of the speech-act in some way. There's some negation. But the reason why I left it in is cuz	0
Mm-hmm.	0
you might have a change of state, let's say, where some state holds and then some state  doesn't  hold, and you're just talking, you know -	0
if you're trying to have the nuts and bolts of simulation you need to know that, you know, whatever, the holder doesn't and -	0
No, I th- I think at this lev- which is - it should be where you have it.	0
O_K, it's - so it's - it's - it's fine where it is. So, O_K.	0
I mean, how you  get  it may - may in- will often involve the discourse but - but -	0
May come from a few places.	0
by the time you're simulating you sh- y- you should  know  that.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
So,  I'm still just really not clear on what I'm looking at.  The "scenario" box, like, what does that look like for an example? Like, not all of these things are gonna be here. This is just basically says	1
Yeah.	0
Correct.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
It's a grab bag of -	1
" part  of what I'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of s- uh, schemas, image, and [MASK]	1
Here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there".	0
So that's exactly what it is. And for a particular instance which I will, you know, make an example of  something , is that you might have an instance of container and path, let's say, as part of your, you know, "into"	0
O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
you know, definition. So you would eventually have instances filled in with various - various values for all the different slots. And they're bound up in, you know, their bindings and - and - and values.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
W- it c-	0
Do you have to say about the binding in your - is there a slot in here for - that tells you how the bindings are done?	0
No, no, no. I - let's see, I think we're - we're not - I don't think we have it quite right yet.	0
O_K.	0
So, uh, what  this  is, let's suppose for the moment it's complete.	0
O_K.	0
O_K, uh, then this says that when	1
an analysis is  finished,  the  whole  analysis is  finished,   you'll have as a  result,  uh, [MASK] for that utterance in context, which is	1
Mm-hmm.	0
made up  entirely  of	0
these  things and, uh, bindings among them.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And [MASK]	1
Mm-hmm.	0
So that - that the who- that this is the	1
tool  kit under whi- out of which you can make [MASK]	1
Mm-hmm.	0
So that's  A_ . But  B_ , which is more relevant to  your  life, is this is  also	0
O_K.	0
the tool kit that is used in [MASK]	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So this is an- that anything you have,	1
O_K.	0
in the party  line,   anything you have as [MASK] comes,	0
from  pieces  of this - ignoring li- I mean, in general, you ignore  lots  of it. But it's got to be pieces of this along with constraints  among  them.	1
Right.	0
O_K.	0
Uh, so that the, you know, goal of the, uh	0
uh, "source, path, goal" has to be the landmark of the conta- you know, the interior of this container. Or whate- whatever. So those constraints	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
appear in constructions but	1
Mm-hmm.	0
pretty  much this is the full range of [MASK]  available  to you.	1
O_K.	0
Except for "cause",  that  I forgot. But anyway, there's som- some kind of [MASK]	1
Yeah.	0
O_K, good. Let's - let's mark that. So we need a c-	1
Uh, I mean, so it gets a little funny. These are all -  so  far these structures, especially from "path" and on down, these are sort of relatively familiar, um, [MASK]	0
Now with "cause", uh, the  fillers  will actually be  themselves   frames.  Right? So you'll say, "event one causes event B_ - uh, event  two ", and -	0
Right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And - and - and - and this - this - this again may ge- our, um - and we - and - and, of course,  worlds.	0
Yeah. So that's, uh these are all implicitly one - within, uh within one world. Um,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
even though saying that place takes place, whatever. Uh, if y- if I said "time" is, you know, "past",	0
that would say "set that this world", you know, " somewhere,  before the world that corresponds to our current speech time".	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
So. But that - that - that's sort of O_K. The - the - within the event it's st- it's still one world.	0
Um.	0
Yeah, so "cause" and - Other frames that could come in - I mean, unfortunately you  could  bring in say for instance, um, uh, " desire " or something like that, like " want ".	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And actually there  is  right now under [MASK]   um, "attitude"? "Volition"?  could  fill that. So there are a  couple  things where I like, "oh, I'm not sure if	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I wanted to have it  there  or -" Basically there was a  whole  list of - of possible speaker attitudes that like say Talmy listed. And, like,  well,	1
Well that's -	0
I don't - you know, it was like "hope, wish. desire", blah-blah-blah. And it's like, well,	0
Right.	0
Uh-huh.	0
I feel like if I  wanted  to have an extra meaning - I don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place. So - They're more lexically marked, right? At  least  in  English.	1
Mmm.	0
So if I  wanted  to I would stick in an extra  frame  in my  meaning,  saying,	0
e- so th- it'd be [MASK] them, right? You know, like	0
"Naomi wants - wants su- a certain situation and that situation itself is a state of affairs".	0
S- right. So - so, "want" itself can be -  i- i- i- i- i-	0
u-	0
Can be just another frame that's part of your -	0
Well, and it- i-  basically  it's an  action.	0
In - in our s- in our - in our -	0
Yeah. Situation.  Right, right.	0
in - in our - in our s- terminology, "want" can be an action and "what you want" is a world.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Hmm.	0
Mmm.	0
So that's - I mean, it's certainly  one  way to do it. Yeah, there - there are	0
Mm-hmm.	0
other things.  Causal  stuff we  absolutely  need. [MASK] we need. The context we need. Um, so anyway, Keith -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
So is this	0
comfortable  to you that, uh, once we have this defined,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
it is your tool kit	0
for building [MASK] And then when we  combine  constructions semantically, the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the  final  one.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
And that's the wh- and - and I mean, that - according to the party  line,  that's the  whole  story.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.  Um. y-	0
Right. That makes sense. So I mean, there's this stuff in the - off in the scenario, which just tells you how various - what schemas you're using and  they're -  how they're bound together. And I guess that some of [MASK] -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
is that where you would sa- I mean, that's -  O_K, that's where [MASK] is which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of, um,	1
Right.	0
Exactly.	0
of this. I mean, what's interesting is that [MASK] -	1
Hmm.  There's almost - I mean, we keep coming back to how focus is like this - this, uh, [MASK] thing. So if I say, um,	0
Yeah.	0
You know, "In France it's like  this ". You know, great, we've learned something about France but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about	0
some implicit contrast, like "In  France  it's like  this ". And therefore you're supposed to say, "Boy, life  sure  -" You know, "in France kids are allowed to drink at age  three ". And w- you're - that's not just a fact about France. You also conclude something about how boring it is here in the U_ S.  Right? And so -	0
Right.	0
Right, right.	0
Right.	0
S- so I would prefer not to worry about that for right now and to think that there  are,  um,	0
O_K.	0
That comes in and, uh -	0
[MASK] in a sense, topic -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
then - just  done  the same way - just actually in the same way as the lower level. If you stressed, you know, " John  went to the -", you know, "the bar" whatever, you're focusing that and	1
Mm-hmm.	0
a- in- a possible inference is "in contrast to other things". So similarly for a whole sentence, you know, "in  France  such-and-such happens".	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
So the whole thing is sort of like again  implicitly  as opposed to other things that are possible.	0
Yeah.	0
Uh, just - just, uh, look - read uh even sem- semi formal Mats Rooth.	1
I mean -	0
Yeah.	0
Uh-huh.	0
If you haven't read it. It's nice. And just pick any paper on alternative semantics.	0
Uh-huh.	0
O_K.	0
So that's his - that's the  best  way of talking about focus, is I think his way.	0
O_K, what was the name?	0
Mats. M_A_T_S. Rooth.	0
O_K.	0
I think two O_'s, yes, T_H. I  never  know how to pronounce his name because he's sort of,	0
O_K.	0
S- Swede?	0
uh,  he is   Dutch   and, um - but very confused background  I think .	0
Dutch? Oh, Dutch.	0
Yeah.	0
Uh-huh.	0
So  and, um,	0
Mats  Gould .	0
And  sadly  enough he also  just  left [MASK] in  Stuttgart.  So he's not there anymore. But, um -	0
Hmm.	0
I don't know where he is right now but alternative semantics is - if you type that into an, uh, uh, browser or search engine you'll get tons of stuff.	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
O_K, thanks.	0
And what I'm kind of confused about is - is what the speaker and the hearer is - is sort of doing	1
there.	1
So for a particular segment it's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation, right? So for a particular segment	1
Yeah.	0
the speaker might be  you  or might be  me.  Um,  hearer  is a little bit harder. It could be like multiple people. I guess that - that - that - that's not very clear from here - I mean, that's not allowed here.	0
Yeah, but you - Don't we  ultimately  want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place, because "you", "me", "he", "they", you know, "these guys",	1
all  these  expressions, nuh, are in - in much the same way [MASK] as "here," and "now," and "there" -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Now, this is - this is assuming you've already solved that. So it's - it's Fred and Mary, so the speaker would be Fred and the -	0
Ye- yeah. So th-	0
Ah!	0
Right, so the  constructions  might - of  course  will refer, using pronouns or whatever. In which case they have to  check  to see,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
uh,  who  the, uh, speaker in  here  wa-  in order to   resolve  those. But when you actually say that "he walked into -", whatever, um,	1
the " he " will refer to a particular - You - you will already have figured who "he" or "you", mmm, or " I ", maybe is a bett- better example, who "I" refers to.	1
Um, and then you'd just be able to refer to  Harry,  you know, in wherever that person - whatever role that person was playing in the event.	0
Mmm.	0
That's up at the reference part.	1
Yeah, yeah.	0
And down there in the speaker-hearer part?	0
S- so,  that's  - I think  that's  just -	0
n-	0
for instance, Speaker is known from the situation, right? You're - when you hear something you're told who the speaker is - I mean, you know who the speaker is.	1
In fact, that's kind of constraining how - in some ways you know this  before  you get to the - you fill in all the rest of it. I  think.	0
Mmm.	0
I mean, how else would you	0
um -	0
You know, uh, uh, it's -  the speaker may - in English is allowed to say "I." Uh, among the twenty-five percent most used words. But wouldn't the " I " then set up [MASK] -	0
Yeah. Well, here -	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
that happens to be the  speaker  this time and not "they," whoever they are. Or "you" - much like the "you" could n-	0
Right, right. So -	0
S- so - O_K, so I would say ref- under [MASK] should be something that corresponds to "I". And mayb	0
So  that's  "I" but, uh, uh, should we say it - it  refers  to,  what?  Uh, if it were " Harry " it would refer to like [MASK] If it were - if it's " I "  it would  refer to the current speaker,	0
O_K, which is given to be like, you know, whoever it is.	0
Well, not - not  always.  I mean, so there's "and then he said, I w-" Uh-huh.	0
" I " within the current  world.	0
Uh -	0
Yeah.  That's right.  So - so  again,  this - uh, this - this is gonna to get us into [MASK] and t- because	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mmm.	0
you know, "Fred said that Mary said -", and whatever. And - and so we're, uh	1
Mm-hmm. Twhhh-whhh.	0
gonna have to, um, chain those as well.	1
But -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So this  entire  thing	0
Right.	0
is inside a world, not just like the top part.	0
Right.	0
I - I think, uh -	0
That's -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Except s- it's - it's trickier than that because	0
um, the  reference  for example -	0
So  he-  where it gets  really  tricky is there's some things, and this is where blends and all terribl- So, some things which  really   are  meant to be	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
identified  and some things which  aren't.  And again, all we need for the moment is some way to	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
say  that.	0
So I  thought  of having like - for [MASK] having the list of - of the things t- with which it is identified. You know, which - which, uh you know, you - you - you - for instance, um - So, I guess,	0
You could do that.	0
it  sort  of depends on if it  is  a referring exp- if it's identifiable already or it's a new thing. If it's a new thing you'd have to like create a structure or whatever.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
If it's an  old  thing it could be referring to, um, usually w- something in a situation, right? Or something in [MASK] So,	1
uh-huh.	0
there's a- you know, whatever, it c- it could  point at  one of these.	0
I just had a - I just had an - an idea that would be very nice if it  works.	1
For what? If it works.	0
Uh, uh, uh, I haven't told you what it is yet. This was my	0
Mm-hmm. Mmm.	0
build-up.  An i- an idea that  would  be nice i-	0
Yeah.	0
O_K, we're crossing our fingers.	0
Right. If it worked.	0
So we're building [MASK] good.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	1
Right, it was [MASK]	0
Um, we  might  be able to handle  context  in the same way that we handle [MASK]	1
because, uh, you have  somewhat  the same things going on of, uh, things being accessible or not. And so, i-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yep.	0
it c- it - it, uh I  think  if we did it right we might be able to get at least a  lot  of the same structure.	1
Use the same -  Yep.	0
So that pulling something out of [MASK] is	1
I  think  similar to other kinds of, uh, [MASK] Uh, I've - I've - I've never seen anybody	1
I see.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And -	0
And -	0
write that up but  maybe  they did. I don't know. That may be all over the literature.	0
Yeah.	0
There's things like ther- you know, there's all  kinds  of stuff like, um, in - I think I mentioned last time in Czech if you have a - a verb of saying then	0
So - so by default -	0
um, you know, you say something like - or - or I was  thinking  you can say something like, "oh, I thought, uh, you are a republican" or something like that. Where as in English you would say, "I thought you  were ". Um, you know, sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb	0
Right.	0
doesn't happen there, so you have to say something about, you know, tense is determined relative to current blah-blah-blah. Same things happens with pronouns. There's languages where, um,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
if you have a verb of saying then,	0
ehhh,	0
where - O_K, so a situation like "Bob said he was going to the movies", where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or  thinking,  you're actually required to have "I" there.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Um, and it's sort of in an extended function -	0
Mm-hmm. So we would have it be in  quotes  in English.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
But it's not perceived as [MASK] I mean, it's been analyzed by the formalists as being	1
Yeah.	0
um which means a pronoun which refers back to the person who is speaking or that sort of thing, right? Um,	1
Oh, right. Yeah, that makes sense.	0
O_K.	0
but - uh, that  happens  to sound like the word for "I" but is actually semantically unrelated to it.	0
Oh, no!	0
Oh, good, I love the formali-	0
Really?	0
Um,	0
Yeah.  Yeah.	0
You're kidding.	0
There's a whole  book  which basically operates on this assumption. Uh, Mary Dalrymple, uh, this book, a ninety-three book on, uh	0
No, that's horrible.	0
O_K.	0
on pronoun stuff.	0
That's horrible.  O_K.	0
Well, yeah. And then the same thing for [MASK] where, you know, you're signing and someone says something. And then, you know, so "he say", and then you sort of do a role shift. And then you sign "I, this, that, and the other". And you know, "I did this".	0
Uh-huh.	0
That's  also  been analyzed as [MASK] and having nothing to do with "I". And the role shift thing is completely left out and so on. So,	0
I mean, the point is that [MASK] uh, you know, sort of ties in with	1
Uh-huh.	0
Yeah.	0
So that - that d- that does sound like it's co- consistent with what we're saying, yeah.	0
Right. Yeah.	0
O_K, so it's kind of like the  unspecified  [MASK] just are occurring in context. And then when you  embed  them sometimes you have to pop up to the h- you know, depending on the construction or the whatever,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um, you - you - you're scope is - m- might extend out to the - the base one.	1
Yeah.	0
It would be nice to actually use the same, um, mechanism since there are so many cases where you actually need it'll be one or the other. It's like, oh, actually, it's the same - same operation. So.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, O_K, so this - this is worth some thought.	0
It's like - it's like what's happening - that, yeah, what- what's happening, uh, there is that you're moving the base space or something like that, right? So that's - that's how Fauconnier would talk about it. And it happens diff- under different circumstances in different languages. And so,	1
Yeah, yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um, things like [MASK] and  tense  which we're thinking of as being these discourse-y things actually are relative t	0
Mm-hmm, right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Robert.	0
Schade.	0
Well,  but, uh, this is very good actually cuz it - it - it - to the extent that it works, it y-	0
Ties it all into it.  Yeah.	0
it - it ties together several of - of  these   things.	0
Yep.	0
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm  sure  gonna read the  transcript  of  this  one. So.  But the, uh, -  But it's too bad that we don't have a camera. You know, all the pointing is gonna be lost.  Uh.	0
Oh, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, that's why I said "point to Robert",  when I did it.	0
Well every time Nancy giggles it means - it means that it's your job.	0
Yeah. Mmm, isn't - I mean, I'm -	1
I  was  sort of dubious why - why he even introduces this sort of reality, you know, as your [MASK] and then builds up -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
d- doesn't start with some - because it's so obvi- it  should  be so obvious, at least it is to me,  that whenever I  say  something I could preface that with "I think."	1
Yeah.	0
Nuh?	0
So there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue.	0
Yeah.	0
No, but there's - there's a Gricean  thing  going on there, that when you say "I think" you're actually [MASK]	1
Mmm.	0
Yeah, I mean -	0
It's like I don't  totally  think -	0
Yeah.  Y-	0
Right.	0
I  mostly  think, uh -	0
Yeah, it's -  Absolutely.	0
Yeah, it's an - it's an evidential. It's sort of semi-grammaticalized. People have talked about it this way. And you know, you can do sort of special things. You can, th-	0
put just the phrase "I think" as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on, and so forth. So -	0
Actually one of the child language researchers who works with T-  Tomasello  studied a bunch of these constructions and it was like it's not using any kind of interesting  embedded  ways just to mark, you know, uncertainty or something like that. So.	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, but about [MASK] I mean, those - those tend to be,	0
um, funky anyways because they blur -	0
So we don't have that in here  either  do we?	1
Yeah.	0
[MASK]	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
Hhh,  I - there used to be a slot for speaker, um,	1
it was something like factivity. I couldn't really remember what it  meant  so I took it out.  But it's something - we - we were talking about sarcasm too, right?	0
Yeah.  Um.	0
Well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that, right? I mean,	1
Oh, oh. Oh, yeah, yeah, right.	0
that's what I  think  is, um, sort of telling you what percent reality you should give this or the, you know -	0
So we probably should.	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Confidence or something like that.	1
Yeah, and the fact that I'm, you know - the fact maybe if I think it versus he thinks that might, you know, depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever, you know -	0
Yeah.	0
Uh  great word in the  English  language is called "about".	0
If you study how people use that it's also - "about."	0
What's the word?	0
About.	0
It's about -	0
Oh, that - in  that  use of "about", yeah.	0
clever.	0
Oh, oh, oh, as [MASK]	0
Yeah.	0
And I think - And I think  y- if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get George started on that.	0
He wrote a paper about thirty-five years ago on that one.	0
I r- I  read  that paper, [MASK] I read  some  of that paper actually.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti-lock brakes?	0
Yeah.	0
What?	0
No.	0
Ask me about it later I'll tell you how.	0
When we're not on tape.	0
I'd love to know.	0
Oh, man.	0
So, and - and I think, uh,  someone  had raised like sarcasm as a	1
complication at some point. And	1
There's all that stuff. Yeah, let's - I - I don't - I think -	0
we just won't deal with sarcastic people.	0
Yeah, I mean -	0
I don't really know what like -	0
We - we don't have to care too much about the speaker attitude, right? Like there's not so many different -	1
hhh,  I don't know, m-	0
Certainly not as some - Well, they're intonational markers I think for the most part. I don't	0
Yeah.	0
I just mean -	0
know too much about the like grammatical -	0
There's lots of different attitudes that - that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify, and so on, and so forth. But like	1
Yeah.	0
what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes?	1
Right.	0
Right, so, uh, this - this raises the question of what are our current purposes.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Oh, yeah, do we have any?	0
Right?	0
Oh, shoot.  Here it is three-fifteen already.	0
Mmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Uh, so, um,	0
I - I don't know the answer but - but, um, it  does  seem that,	0
you know, this is - this is coming along. I think it's - it's converging. It's - as far as I can tell there's this one  major  thing we have to do which is the mental - the whole s-  [MASK] thing.	1
And then there's some other minor things.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um, and we're going to have to s- sort of bound the complexity. I mean, if we get everything that anybody ever thought about you know, w- we'll go nuts.	1
Yeah.	0
So we had  started  with the idea that	1
the  actual,  uh, constraint was	0
related to this tourist domain	1
and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain,	1
assuming that people were being helpful and weren't trying to d- you know, there's all sorts of - God knows, irony, and stuff like - which you - isn't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah ?	0
Yeah.	0
Uh.	0
M- mockery.	0
Right. Whatever. So	0
y- uh, no end of things th- that - that, you know, we  don't  deal with. And -	0
But it -	0
i- isn't that part  easy  though because in terms of the s- simspec, it would just mean you put one more set of brack- brackets around it, and then just tell it to sort of negate whatever the content of that is in terms of irony or -	0
Go ahead.	0
Yeah.	0
N- no. No.	0
Mmm.	0
Right.	0
Maybe.  Yeah, in [MASK] cuz the semantics is always like "speaker believes  not-P ", you know?  Like "the speaker says P_ and believes not-P_". But -	0
No.	0
Right.	0
We have a theoretical model of sarcasm now. Yeah, right, I mean.	0
Right, right, but,	0
Right. No, no.  Anyway,  so - so, um, I  guess	0
uh, let me make a  proposal  on how to proceed on that, which is that, um,	0
it was Keith's, uh, sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions. Uh, and my suggestion to Keith is that	1
you, over the next couple weeks, n- don't try to do them in detail or formally but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have. Uh, and then when Robert gets back we'll look at the set of them.	1
Mmm.	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
Just - just sort of, you know, define your space.	1
Yeah, O_K.	0
And, um, so th- these are - this is a set of things that I think we ought to deal with.	0
Yeah.	0
And then we'll - we'll - we'll go back over it and w- people will - will give feedback on it. And then - then we'll have a - at least initial	0
O_K.	0
spec of - of what we're actually trying to do. And that'll also be useful for anybody who's trying to write a  parser.	1
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.  In case there's any around.	0
Knowing uh -	0
If we knew anybody like that.	1
Right,	0
"who might want-" et cetera. So,	0
O_K.	0
uh -	0
So a- and we get this - this, uh,  portals  fixed and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range. And then of course Nancy you're gonna have to, uh, do  your  set of - but you have to do that  anyway.	0
For the same, yeah, data. Yeah, mm-hmm.	0
So - so we're gonna get the- w- we're basically dealing with  two  domains, the tourist domain and the - and the child language learning. And we'll see what we need for	1
Mmm.	0
those  two.  And then my proposal would be to, um, not  totally  cut off more general discussion but to focus  really   detailed  work on the subset of things that we've - we really want to get  done.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And then as a kind of separate thread, think about the more general things and - and all  that.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Well, I also think the detailed discussion will hit - you know, bring us to problems that are of a general nature and maybe even -	0
Uh, without doubt.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah. But what I want to do is - is - is to - to constrain the things that we  really  feel responsible for.	0
even suggest some solutions. Yeah.	0
Mmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So that - that we say  these  are the things we're  really  gonna try do by the end of the  summer	0
and other things we'll put on a list of - of research problems or something, because	0
you can  easily  get to the point where  nothing  gets done because every time you start to do something you say, "oh, yeah, but what about this case?"	0
Mm-hmm.	0
This is - this is called being a linguist.	0
Mmm.	0
Yeah.	0
And, uh,	0
Basically.	0
Or  me.   Or  me.    Anyways  -	0
Huh?	0
Right.	0
There's that quote in Jurafsky and Martin where - where it goes - where some guy goes, "every time I fire a linguist the performance of the recognizer goes up."	0
Yeah.	0
Exactly.	0
Right.	0
But  anyway.  So, is - is that - does that make sense as a, uh -	0
Sure, yeah.	0
a general way to proceed?	0
Yeah, yeah, we'll start with that, just figuring out what needs to be done then actually	0
the next step is to start trying to  do  it.  Got it.	0
Exactly right.	0
Mmm.	0
Mmm.	0
O_K.	0
We have a little bit of news, uh, just minor stuff. The one big -	0
Ooo, can I ask a -	0
You ran out of power.	0
Huh?	0
Can I ask a quick question about this side?	0
Yes.	0
Yeah.	0
Is this, uh - was it intentional to leave off things like "inherits" and -	1
Oops.	0
Um,	0
No.	0
not really - just on the constructions, right?	0
Yeah, like constructions can inherit from other things, am I right? Yeah.	0
Um,	0
yeah.	0
I didn't want to think too much about that for - for now.	1
O_K.	0
So, uh, maybe it was subconsciously intentional.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, uh - yeah.	0
Um, yeah, there should be - I - I wanted to s- find out  someday  if there was gonna be some way of dealing with,	1
uh, if this is the right term, [MASK] where one construction is inheriting from, uh	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh-huh.	0
from both parents, uh, or different ones, or three or four different ones. Cuz the problem is that then you have to -	1
Yep.	0
Yeah. So let me -	0
Yeah.	0
Refer to  them.	0
which of - you know, which are - how they're getting bound together.	0
Yeah, right, right, right.	0
Yeah, and - and there are certainly cases like that. Even with just [MASK] we have some examples. So,	0
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	0
Right.	0
and we've been talking a little bit about that anyway.	0
Yeah. So what I would  like  to do is separate that problem out. So	1
Inherits.	0
O_K.	0
um, my  argument  is there's	0
nothing you can do  with  that that you can't do by just having more	0
Yeah, yes.	0
constructions. It's uglier and it d- doesn't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff. Uh,	0
That's right.	0
But whatever. Yeah, no, no, no no. No, by all means, right. Uh, sure.	0
Uh, those are over rated.	0
Right.	0
And so I - what I'd like to do is - is in the  short  run focus on	1
getting it  right.  And when we think we have it right then saying, "aha!, can we make it more elegant?"	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah, that's -	0
Yeah.	0
Can - can we, uh - What are the generalizations, and stuff? But rather than try to guess	0
Connect the dots.   Yeah.	0
[MASK] and all that sort of stuff before we know what we're doing. So I would say in the  short  run	0
Yep.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
we're not gonna b-	0
First  of all, we're not doing them  yet  at  all.	0
And - and it could be that half way through we say, "aha!, we - we now see how we want to clean it up."	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh, and  inheritance  is only one - I mean, that's  one  way to organize it but there are  others.  And it may or may not be the  best  way.	0
Yeah.	0
I'm sorry, you had  news.	0
Mmm.	0
Oh, just small stuff. Um,	1
thanks to Eva on our web site we can now,	1
if you want to run [MASK] uh, you could see - get - download these classes.	1
And then it will enable you - she modified the GUI so it has now a m- a m- a button menu item for saving it into [MASK] So that's wonderful.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mmm.	0
Great.	0
And, um and she, a- You tested it  out.  Do you want to say something about that, that it works, right? With the -	0
I was just checking like, when we wanna, um,	0
get [MASK] of, like, variables.	0
You know how you asked whether we can, like, just observe all the variables like in the same  list ? You can't. You have to make separate queries every time.	0
Uh-huh.	0
O_K, that's - that's a bit unfortunate but	0
So -	0
Yeah.	0
for the time  being  it's - it's - it's  fine  to do it -	0
You just have to have a long list of, you know, all the variables. Basically.	0
Yeah.	0
But uh -	0
Uh, all the things you want to query, you just have to like ask for separately.	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
Well that's - probably maybe in the long term that's good news because it forces us to think a little bit more carefully how - how we want to get an out- output. Um, but that's a different discussion for a different time.	0
And, um, I don't know. We're  really  running  late,  so I had, uh, an idea	0
yesterday  but, uh, I don't know whether we should even start  discussing.	0
W- what - Yeah, sure, tell us what it is.	0
Um,	1
[MASK] that, um, has been  pointed  to but hasn't been, um, made  precise  by any means, um,	0
may w- may work as follows. I thought that we would, uh -	1
that the following thing would be in-  incredibly  nice and I have  no  clue whether it will work at all or nothing. So that's just a tangent, a couple of mental disclaimers here. Um, imagine you - you write [MASK] um -	1
[MASK]	0
[MASK]  um,  completely  from scratch  every  time you	1
O_K.	0
Just a white piece of paper.	0
Mmm, right.	0
You  consult   - [MASK] which will tell you a bunch of stuff, and parts, and properties, uh-uh-uh	1
Grout out the things that - that you need.	1
Right.	0
then y- you'd simply write, uh, these into - onto your - your white piece of paper. And	0
you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there. You won't get -	1
you won't  really  get [MASK]  therefore we need everything that -	1
that  configures  to what the situation is, I_E, [MASK] So you get whatever comes from discourse	1
but also  filtered.  Uh, so only [MASK] from the discourse plus the situat	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And that fills in [MASK] with which you can then query, um, the - the net that you just wrote	1
and find out [MASK]	1
U_. And [MASK] works exactly like that, that once you -	1
we  have,  you know, precise format in which to  write  it, so we write it  down.  You query it. You get the  result,  and you throw it away.	0
And the - the  nice  thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and  think  about it or  write  about it.	0
You may have some general  rules  as to [MASK] as what, so that will allow you	1
to craft the - the - the initial notes. But it's - in  that  respect it's completely scalable.	1
Because it doesn't  have  any prior, um,  configuration.  It's just you need [MASK] and you	0
modules.  And if  this  can be made to work	0
at  all,   that'd be kind of  funky.	0
Um, it sounds to me like you want [MASK]	0
[MASK]- uh,	0
Beca- because it - b- because -	0
No, no, you  can't.  See the - the  critical  thing about [MASK] is it gives these relations in general form. So once you have  instantiated	1
[MASK] with the  instances  and ther- then you can - then you can unfold it.	1
Then you can.	0
Mm-hmm, yeah. No, I was m- using it generic. So,	0
uh, probabilistic, whatever, [MASK] Whatever you  write  it. In -	0
Well, no, but it matters a  lot  because you - what you  want  are these generalized  rules	0
about the way things relate, th- that you then  instantiate  in each case.	0
And then - then instantiate them. That's ma- maybe the - the way - the  only  way it works.  @@	0
Yeah, and that's -	0
Yeah, that's the only way it  could  work. I - we have a - our local expert on [MASK] uh, but my guess is that they're not currently good enough to do that. But we'll - we'll have to see.	0
Uh -	0
But, uh,	0
Yes.  This is - that's - that would be a good thing to try.	0
It's  related  to [MASK]	0
in that you th- you throw everything into a pot and you try to come up with the, uh -	0
Except there's no - no [MASK] involved.	0
Best explanation.	0
No, there isn't [MASK] but there - but - but the, um,	0
The cove- the - [MASK] are like rules of inference and you're - you're coupling a bunch of them together. And then ins- instead of  proving  you're trying to, you know, compute the most  likely.	0
Mm-hmm, yeah.	0
Uh -	0
Tricky.	0
But you - yeah, it's a good - it's a - it's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal.	0
What's it?	0
So are you gonna write something for us before you go?	0
Yes. Um.	0
Oh, you  have  something.	0
In the  process  thereof, or whatever.	0
O_K.	0
So, what's - what - when are we gonna meet again?	0
When are you leaving? Thursday, Friday?	0
Fri- uh, Thursday's my last day here. So -	0
Fri-	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
I would suggest as soon as possible. Do you mean by we, the whole ben- gang?	0
N- no, I didn't mean y- just the  two  of us. We - obviously we can - we can  do  this. But the question is do you want to,	1
for example, send the little group, uh, a draft of your thesis proposal and get, uh, another session on feedback on that? Or -	1
We can do it Th- Thursday again. Yeah.	1
Fine with me.	0
Should we do the one P_M time	0
for Thursday since we were on that before or - ?	0
Sure.	0
O_K.	0
Alright.	0
Hmm.	0
Thursday at one? I can also maybe then sort of run through the, uh - the talk I have to give at [MASK] which highlights all of our work.	0
O_K.	0
And we can make some last minute changes on that.	0
O_K.	0
You can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper.	0
That- that'll tell him  exactly  what's going on. Yeah, that -	0
Alright.	0
Can we do - can we do one-thirty?	0
No.	0
Oh, you already told me no. One, O_K, it's fine. I can do one. It's fine.	0
But we can do  four.	0
It's fine.	0
One or four. I don't care.	1
To me this is equal.  I don't care.	0
If it's equal for all? What should we do?	0
Yeah, it's fine. Fine. Yeah - no, no, no, uh, I don't care. It's fine.	0
Four?	0
It's equal to all of us, so you can decide one or four.	0
The pressure's on  you  Nancy.	0
Liz  actually said she  likes  four because it forces the  Meeting  Recorder people to cut, you know - the discussions short.	0
O_K.	0
O_K, four.	1
O_K? O_K. I am.	0
Well, if you insist, then.	0
