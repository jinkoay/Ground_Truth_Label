O_K	0
So	1
uh	1
today	1
we're looking at a	1
number of uh	1
things we're trying	1
and uh	0
fortunately for listeners to this uh	0
we lost some of it's visual	0
but um	0
got tables in front of us.	0
Um	0
what is - what does combo mean?	0
So combo is um	0
a system where we have these features	0
that go through a network and then	0
this same string of features but low-pass filtered with the low-pass filter used in	0
the M_S_G features.	0
And so these low-pass filtered	0
goes through M_ eh - another M_L_P	0
and then the linear output of these two M_L_P's are combined	0
just by adding the values and then there is this K_L_T.	0
Um	0
the output is used as	0
uh features as well.	0
Um	0
so	0
let me try to restate this and see if I have it right.	0
There is uh -	0
there is the features	0
uh there's the O_G_I features	0
and	0
then um	0
those	0
features	0
um	0
go through a contextual - uh l- l- let's take this bottom arr-	0
one pointed to by the bottom arrow.	0
Um those features	0
go through a contextualized K_L_T.	0
Yeah.	0
Then	0
these features also	0
uh get	0
um low-pass filtered	0
Yeah so	0
yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard	0
Sure.	0
Yeah. Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
The graph, yeah another one.	0
@@	0
Yeah, that's good.	0
So	0
So we have these features from O_G_I	0
Yeah.	0
that goes through the three paths.	0
Three, O_K.	0
The first	0
is a K_L_T using	0
several	0
frames	0
Yeah.	0
of the features.	0
Yeah.	0
The second path	0
is uh M_L_P	0
also using nine frames - several frames of features	0
Yeah.	0
Uh-huh.	0
The third path	0
is this low-pass filter.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Uh, M_L_P	0
Aha! aha!	0
Adding the outputs just like in the second propose- the - the proposal from - for the first evaluation.	0
Yeah?	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
And then	0
No, the K_L_T.	0
the K_L_T	0
And those two together.	0
and then the two together again.	0
That's it.	0
Two H_T_K.	0
Um.	0
O_K so that's - that's this bottom one.	0
So	0
this is - yeah	0
And so uh	0
and then the - the - the one at the top - and I presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they're the best?	0
Yeah that's the reason, yeah.	0
Oh let's focus on them then- so what's the block diagram for the one above it?	0
For the f- the f- first	0
yellow line you mean?	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah	0
so it's uh basically s- the same except that we don't have this	0
Step.	0
uh low-pass filtering so we have only two streams.	0
Well.	0
There's - there's no	0
low -	0
low-pass processing	0
Mm-hmm.	0
used as additional feature stream.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um	0
Do you e- um they mentioned - made some - uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they - they mentioned some	1
weighting	1
scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers.	1
Yeah.	0
Uh actually the way things seems to	0
um well	1
it's uh	1
forty percent for T_I-digit, sixty for	1
all the SpeechDat-Cars, well all these languages.	1
Ehm	0
the well match is forty, medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty-five.	0
Yeah.	0
Um and we don't have the T_I-digits part yet?	1
Uh, no.	0
O_K.	0
But	0
yeah.	0
Generally what you observe with T_I-digits is that the result are very close	1
whatever the - the system.	1
O_K.	0
And so	1
Yeah.	0
have you	1
put all these numbers together	1
into a single number representing that? I mean not -	1
Uh not yet. No.	1
O_K so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good - then we could compare the two and say what was better.	1
Mmm yeah, yeah.	0
Mmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Um	0
and how does this compare	0
to the numbers -	0
oh so O_G_I two is just the top -	0
Yeah.	0
top row?	0
So yeah to -	0
actually O_G_I two is the -	1
the baseline with the O_G_I features	1
but	1
this is not exactly the result that they have	1
because they've - they're still	1
made some changes in the	1
features	1
O_K.	0
and - well	1
but	1
uh	1
actually	1
our results are better than their results.	1
Um	1
I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results	1
O_K.  Uh	1
Uh	0
O_K so the one - one place	1
where it looks like we're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian.	1
Yeah. Yeah.	0
An-	0
Yeah there is something funny happening here because - yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
But there are thirty-six and then	0
sometimes we are - we are - we are around forty-two and	0
Now up	0
but	0
Uh so	1
one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a - a second um silence detection.	1
Yeah. So there are	0
some results here	0
For the Italian. For this one.	0
uh so the	0
third and the fifth line of the table	0
So filt is what that is?	0
Filt, yeah	0
Yeah.	0
Um	1
yeah so it seems f- for the - the well match and mismatched condition	1
it's uh	1
it brings something.	1
Uh but	1
uh actually	1
apparently there are - there's no	1
room left for any	1
silence detector	1
at the server side because of the delay.	1
Uh	0
Oh we can't do it. Oh O_K.	1
well	0
No.	1
For that - for that we -	0
Oh.  Too bad.	0
Uh	0
Good idea, but can't do it. O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
Except I don't know because they -	0
I think they are still working well.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Uh t- two days ago they were still working on this	0
trying to reduce	0
the delay of the silence detector	0
so but	0
yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh	0
some kind of compromise between the delay that's on the handset and on the server side.	0
Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and -	0
but well hmm	0
For the moment they have this large delay on the -	0
the feature computation and	0
O_K.	0
So	0
so we don't	0
Alright so for now at least that's not	0
there	0
you have some results with low-pass filter cepstrum	0
doesn't have a huge effect but it - but it looks like it	0
you know maybe could help in a couple places.	0
I th-	0
Yeah.	0
Uh little bit.	0
Um	0
and um	0
um	0
Yeah	0
and uh	0
let's see	0
What else did we	0
have in there? Uh	0
I guess it makes a l- um at this point this is	0
I - I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit uh	0
And you - you yellowed these out uh but uh	0
uh	0
Oh I see yeah that - that one you can't use because of the delay.	0
Those look pretty good.	0
Um	0
let's see that one	0
Well even the - just the - the second row doesn't look that bad right? That's just uh	0
Yep.	0
yeah? And - and	0
Mmm yeah.	0
that looks like an interesting one too.	0
Uh	0
Actually the - yeah the second line is	0
uh	0
pretty much like the first line in yellow	0
except that we don't have this K_L_T on the first - on the left part of the diagram.	0
We just have the features	0
as they are.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And it's - it's - it's a little - slightly simpler.	0
Yeah.	0
So -	0
so there's - so I - I would put that one also as a - as a maybe.	0
Uh	0
and it - yeah and it's	0
actually  does - does significantly better on the uh	0
uh highly mismatched Italian, so	0
s- and little worse on the	0
mis- on the M_M case, but	0
uh	0
Well yeah it's worse than a few things	0
Mm-hmm.	0
so uh	0
let's see how that c- that c- c- see how that comes out on their -	0
their measure and - are - are we running this uh for T_I-digits or uh	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Now is T_I di - is- is that part of the result that they get for the uh development - th- the results that they're supposed to get at the end of - end of the month, the T_I-digits are there also?	0
Yeah.	0
It's included, yeah.	0
Oh O_K.	0
O_K.	0
And see what else there is here.	0
Um	0
Oh I see - the one - I was looking down here at the - the o- the row below the	0
lower yellowed one.	0
Uh that's	0
Mm-hmm?	0
uh	0
that's with the reduced uh K_L_T size -	0
Yeah.	0
reduced dimensionality.	0
Yeah.	0
What happens there	0
is it's around the same	0
and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying	0
before a bit perhaps.	0
Yeah, it's - it's significantly worse well but - Mm-hmm.	0
It's significantly worse - it's -	0
Exc- except for the H_M	0
it's uh	0
For many a mismatch it's worse.	0
but	0
it's - it's mostly worse.	0
Yeah.	0
But it is little. I mean	0
not - not by a huge amount, I don't know.	0
What are - what are the sizes of any of these sets, I - I'm - I'm sure you told me before, but I've forgotten.	0
So - you know how many words	1
Uh	0
are in	1
uh one of these test sets?	1
I don't remember.	0
Um	1
About?	0
it's -	1
it depends - well -	1
the well matched is generally larger	1
than the other sets	1
and I think it's around	0
Ye-	0
two thousand or three thousand words perhaps, at least.	0
But words -	0
Hmm?	0
well word - I don't know.	0
The words, yeah.	0
Sentences.	0
S- sentences.	0
Some sets have five hundred sentences,	0
so.	0
Yeah.	0
Mmm.	0
So the - so the sets - so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences, let's say	0
and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it - most of them longer or	0
Yeah for the Italian	0
Yeah.	0
It - it d-	0
even seven digits y- more or less but sometime	0
Seven digits.	0
the sentence have only one digit and sometime	0
uh like uh the number of uh credit cards, something like that.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right, so between one and sixteen. See the - I mean the reason I'm asking is - is - is we have all these small differences and I don't know	1
Mm-hmm?	0
how seriously to take them, right? So	1
Yeah.	0
uh i- if - if you had uh just	1
you know - to give an example, if you had uh	1
um	1
if you had a thousand words	1
then uh a - a tenth of a percent would just be one word, right? So - so it wouldn't mean anything.	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh  - um	1
so um	1
yeah it be kind of - I'd kind of like to know what the	1
sizes of these test sets were actually.	1
The size that we have?	0
Yeah. We could - we could run - run some kind of significance tests or	0
Yeah since these -	0
well also just to know the numbers, right. So these - these are word error rates so this is on how many words.	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yep.	0
Yeah we have the result that the output of the H_T_K	0
Yeah.	0
The number of -	0
of sentences, no it's the number isn't.	0
Yeah sure - sure. Yeah sure. Yeah.	0
Yeah so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then - then - that - that be great.	1
Yeah.	0
Um	0
what else is there here?	0
Um see the second -	0
second from the bottom it says S_I_L, but this is some different kind of silence or thing or -	0
what was that?	0
Uh	0
It the -	0
the output silence of the M_L_P.	0
Oh yeah I see.	0
It's only one small experiment to know what happened.	1
To apply	1
also to in- include also the -	1
the silence of the M_L_P we have the fifty-six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those.	1
Yes.	0
Uh-huh, uh-huh.	0
The silence plus the K_L_T output?	1
Oh so you're only using the silence.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, because when we apply	0
the K_L_T	0
No they're - I think there is this silence in addition to the um K_L_T outputs it is because we - we - we just keep	1
No.	0
in addition, yes. In addition t-	0
uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the K_L_T	1
and - yeah.	0
and we not s- we are not sure if we pick - we have the silence.	1
So	1
we try to add the silence also in addition to the - these twenty-eight	1
dimensions.	1
I see.	0
O_K.	0
And what - and what's O_G_I forty-five?	0
Uh it's o- it's O_G_I two, it's - so the - th- it's the features from the first line	0
The bottom one there?	0
It's in fact O_G_I two.	0
and - yeah.	0
S-	0
Right, but I mean what's the - what does the last row mean?	0
So it's uh basically this but without the K_L_T	0
on the - from the left path.	0
I thought that was the one - I thought that was the second row.	0
So what's the difference between the second	0
Uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just	0
uh	0
Oh.	0
So this is like the second line but with - with the combo stuff.	0
Yeah.	0
And with the - all the output of the combo.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
Uh	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K, so -	0
alright so it looks to me -	1
I guess the same -	1
given that we have to take the filt ones out of the - the running because of this delay problem -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
so it looks to me like the ones you said	1
I agree are - are the ones to look at but I just would add the -	1
the - the second row one	1
Yeah.	0
Mmm.	0
and then um if we can um	0
oh yeah also	0
when -	0
when they're using this weighting scheme of forty, thirty-five, twenty-five	0
is that on the percentages or on the raw errors? I guess	0
Uh	0
it's probably on the percentages right?	0
I guess, yeah.	0
Yeah O_K.	0
I guess, yeah. Mmm.	0
Alright.	0
It's not clear here.	0
O_K.  Maybe - maybe they'll argue about it.	0
Um	0
O_K so if we can know what - how many words are in each and then um Dave uh	1
Dave promised to get us something tomorrow	1
which will be there	1
Mm-hmm.	0
as far as they've gotten  Friday and then we'll operate with that and	1
Yeah.	0
uh how long did it	0
I guess if we're not doing all these things - if we're only doing	0
um	0
um	0
I guess since this is development data it's legitimate	0
to do more than one, right?	0
Yeah.	0
I mean ordinarily if - in final test data you don't want to do	0
several	0
and - and take the best that's - that's -	0
Mmm.	0
that's not proper but if this is development data we could still	0
look at a couple.	0
Yeah.	0
We can - yeah. Sure. But	0
we have to decide - I mean we have to fix the system	0
on this d- on this data, to choose the best and	0
Yeah.	0
I-	0
Right.	0
these	0
But the question is when - when do we fix the system, do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday?	1
But we could	0
it d-	0
I -	1
I think we fixed on Tuesday, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm.	1
Yeah, O_K except that we do have to write it up.  Also, so	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Um	0
Uh yeah well.	0
Well basically it's this with	0
perhaps some kind of printing and some - some other  @@ .	0
Right so maybe what we do is we - we - we uh as soon as we get the data from them	1
Yeah but	0
Mm-hmm.	0
we start the training and so forth but we start the write-up right away	1
because as you say there - there's only minor differences between these.	1
I think you - we could - we could start soon, yeah.	1
Yeah.	0
Write up something.	1
Yeah, and -	1
Um yeah. Mm-hmm.	0
and I - I would - you know, I would - I'd kind of like to see it maybe I can - I can edit it a bit	1
uh sure.	0
The - my - what in this si- i- in this situation is my forte which is English.	0
Yeah.	0
Uh	0
so	0
Mmm.	0
uh	0
H- yeah. Have y- have you seen alt- d- do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything?	0
Uh not really.	0
O_K.	0
Um	0
There is the format of the table which is	0
quite impressive.	0
Yeah?	0
Uh	0
I see.	0
Yes, for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it's not really that impressive, it's just tiny.	0
It's all these little categories	0
set a, set b, set c, multi-condition, clean.	0
Uh	0
No mitigation.	0
Wow.	0
Do you know what no - what no mitigation means  here ?	0
Um	0
it should be the	0
the problem with the error - channel error or	0
Oh that's probably the -	0
this is probably channel error stuff huh? Oh this is i- right, it says right above here  channel   - channel error resilience, yeah.	0
well, you -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
So recognition performance is just the top part, actually.	0
Uh	0
and they have - yes, split between seen databases and non-seen so basically between development and - and evaluation.	0
Yeah.	0
And  so -	0
right, it's presumed there's all sorts of	0
tuning that's gone on on the	0
see- what they call seen databases and	0
there won't be tuning for the uh unseen.	0
Multi-condition - multi-condition.	0
So they have - looks like they have	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh	0
uh	0
so they splitting up between the T_I-digits and everything else, I see.	0
So the everything else is the SpeechDat-Car, that's the	0
Yeah, so it's not divided between languages you mean or -	0
multi- multilingual	0
Well, it is. It is, but there's also - there's these tables over here for the - for the T_I-digits and these tables over here for the car	0
it just	0
Oh yeah.	0
data which is - which is I guess all the multilingual stuff	0
and then uh there's -	0
Yeah.	0
they also split up between multi-condition and clean only.	0
For T_I-digits.	0
Yes.	0
Yeah, actually yeah. For the T_I-digits they want to train	0
on clean	0
and on noisy	0
Yeah.	0
and - yeah.	0
So we're doing that also, I guess.	0
Uh yeah.	0
But	0
uh we	0
actually -	0
do we have the features? Yeah. For the clean T_I-digits but we did not test it yet.	0
Uh the clean training stuff.	0
O_K.	0
Mmm.	0
Well anyway, sounds like there'll be a lot to do just to  work with our partners to fill out the tables  over the next uh	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Yes.	0
next few days I guess they have to send it out -	1
let's see the thirty-first is uh	0
uh Wednesday and I think the - it has to be there by some	0
hour	0
uh European time on Wednesday so  I think basically	0
Hmm-hmm.	0
We lost time uh Wednesday maybe because	0
E- excuse me?	0
that the difference in the time may be -	0
is  a long  different of the time.	0
Maybe the Thursday	0
the twelfth of the night of the Thurs- thirty-one	0
is -	0
is not valid in Europe.  We don't know is happening.	0
Yeah.	0
Yes, so I mean - I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday  right because I - I think	1
Tuesday.	0
Yeah, well.	0
Except if - if it's the thirty-one at midnight or I don't know -	0
uh	0
we can  still	0
do some work on Wednesday morning.	0
Uh yeah well.	0
Yeah, well.	0
W- i- is but is - is it midni- I thought it was actually something like five P_M	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
on -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
was like - I thought it was five P_M or something, I didn't think it was midnight. I thought they said they wanted everything by	0
Yeah, five P_M.	0
well, so five P_M	0
their time	0
is - is - if	0
Not five P_M, three P_M.	0
three P_M.	0
Three P_M.	0
Alright, that's six in the morning here.	0
It's d-	0
Uh no	0
no.	0
three - three A_- three P_M?	0
No, we are wondering about the - the - the hour	0
that we have to	0
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.	0
eh I don't know if it's three P_M - it's	0
Three P_M here is in Europe midnight.	0
Yeah, it's - it's midnight but	0
Yes, yes, but I didn't think it was midnight that it was due, I thought it was due at some hour during the day like five P_M or something.	0
Oh O_K.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm, maybe.	0
In which case	0
so I - I - uh well we should look but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday.  Um	1
Yeah.	0
so then next Thursday we can sort of have a	1
little aftermath but then - then we'll actually have the new data which is the German and the Danish	1
Yeah.	0
but that really will be much less work because	0
uh the system will be fixed	0
Yeah.	0
so all we'll do is	0
take whatever  they have and -	0
Yeah.	0
and uh and run it through the process. Uh we won't be changing the training on anything	0
Mm-hmm.	0
so there'll be no new training, there'll just be new H_T_K runs, so that's	0
means in some sense we	0
can kind of relax from this after -	0
after Tuesday and -	1
and uh	1
maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of	1
Mm-hmm.	0
uh the research.	1
Um	1
you know what things	1
uh did you think of when you were	1
uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately	1
work on uh	1
Mm-hmm.	0
uh	0
Yeah.	0
so	0
What?	0
Oh, Stephane always has these great ideas and -	0
Sure.	0
oh, but uh we don't have time.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
I'm not sure these are great ideas.	0
But they're ideas.	0
Yeah?	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, that was good. And - and uh also it's still true that uh	0
Yeah.	0
But	0
I think it's true that - that we - we at least got fairly consistent	0
i- improved	0
results	0
by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features rather than	0
uh in sequence which was - was your suggestion and that - that - that seems to have been borne out.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
The fact that none of these are - are - you know, enormous is - is -	0
is not	0
too surprising - most improvements aren't enormous and	0
Yeah.	0
uh some of them are	0
but uh	0
I mean you have something really really wrong  and you fix it  you can get big and really enormous improvements but	0
Mm-hmm.	0
uh	0
um	0
Cuz our best improvements over the years that we've gotten from	0
finding bugs, but	0
Anyway	0
O_K well I - I think - I see where we are and everybody knows what they're doing and is there - is there anything else we should talk about or - or - are we done?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I think it's O_K um.	0
We	0
so basically we will - I think we'll try to -	1
to focus on these three	1
architectures and -	1
and perhaps I was thinking also a fourth one with	1
just - just a single K_L_T because we did not really test that -	1
removing all these K_L_T's and	0
Uh-huh.	0
putting one single K_L_T at the end.	0
Yeah, I mean that would be pretty	1
low maintenance to try it.	1
Yeah.	0
Uh if you can fit it in.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Oh I have - yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh	0
I should tell people outside of this group too uh	0
I don't know if we're gonna need it	0
uh but	0
uh Jeff up at the	0
uh University of Washington	0
has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh	0
of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh I_B_M machines R_S six thousands	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and - and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or - I don't know, eight hundred megahertz or something and	0
there's four processors in a box and there's ten boxes and there's some kind of ti- so if - you know he's got a lot of processing power	0
and um we'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we wanna -	0
wanna - wanna run them he's -	0
he's offering it.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So.	0

is starting to get - are starting to get into a pretty good size collection	1
and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with	1
really pretty soon now so that's - that's another	1
source of data.	1
Um	0
which is	0
s- under somewhat better control and that we can - we can make measurements of the room the - uh that - you know if we feel there's other measurements we don't have that we'd like to have we can make them and	0
uh Dave and I were just talking about that a little while ago	0
Mm-hmm.	0
so	0
uh that's	0
another -	0
another possibility for this - this kind of work.	0
K, uh if nobody has anything else maybe we should go around do - do our digits -	0
do our digits duty.	0
O_K.	0
O_K I'll start.	0
Uh, let me say that again.	0
O_K. I guess we're done.	0
