I like the high quality labeling.	0
S- uh, try speaking loudly, so, O_K, good. Thank you.	0

Besides, I don't want anyone who has a weird accent. Right, Dan?	0
So, I don't understand if it's neck mounted you don't get very good performance.	0
It's  not  neck mounted.  It's  supposed  to be h-  head  mounted.	0
Yeah. It - it  should  be head mounted. Right?	0
Right.	0
Well, then put it on your  head.  What are you  doing?	0
I don't know.	0
Cuz when you do this, you can -	0
Rouww-Rouww.	0
Why didn't I - you were saying that but I could hear you really well on the - on the transcription - on the, uh, tape.	0

Thanks. Should I turn off [MASK] Dan? Do you think that makes any difference?	0
Oh, God. No, let me do it.	0
Why?  Are you gonna do something  other  than hit "quit"?	0
No, but I'm gonna look at the uh, logs as well.	0
Oh.	0
Uh, you said turn off the  what?	0
Should have done it before.	0
[MASK] which tells you what the levels on the various mikes are and there was one hypothesis that perhaps that -	0
Oh.	0
the act of	0
recording [MASK] was one of the things that contributed to the errors.	0
Oh,  I  see.	0
Yeah, but Eric, uh, you didn't think that was a reasonable  hypothesis,  right?	0
I See.	0
That was me, I thought that was -	0
Oh, I'm sorry y-	0
That was malarkey.	0
Well, the only reason that could be is if the driver has a bug.	0
Right? Because the machine just isn't very heavily loaded.	0
No  chance  of  that.	0
No chance of that. Just because it's beta.	0
Yeah, there - there - there was - there was a - there was a bug. There was a glitch last time we ran.	0
Look O_K?	0
Are- are yo- are you recording where the table mikes are by the way? Do you know which channels -	0
No.	0
Yeah, we usually do that.	0
@@    No,  we  don't.	0
Yeah.	0
Why not?	0
But we - we ought to st- we ought to standardize. I think,  uh, I s- I spoke to	0
somebody,   Morgan,   about that.	0
I think - I think we should put mar- Well, no, w- we can do that. I know what they - they're - they're four, three, two, one.	0

I mean, that's what we've done before.	0
In order now.	0
Four.	0
Three,	0
Three.	0
two,  and one. But I think - I think we should put them in standard positions. I think we should make little marks on the table top.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
So that we can put them -	0
Which means we need to move this thing, and sorta decide how we're actually going to do things.	0
I guess that's the point. It'll be a lot easier if we have a - if we have them permanently in place or something like that.	0
So.	0
Right.	0
I do wish there were big booms coming down from the ceiling.	0
You do?	0
Yeah.	0
Would it make you feel more important?	0
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know.	0
Mmm.	0
I  see.	0
Wait  till the  projector  gets installed.	0
Oh, that'll be good. O_K.	0
That'll work.	0
That'll work.	0
Oh, gosh.	0
Cuz it's gonna hang down, make noise.	0
When's  it gonna be  installed?	0

Well,  it depends on	0
I  see.	0
Is this b- is this being recorded?	0
That's right.	0
Uh, I think Lila actually is almost getting r- pretty close to even getting ready to put out the purchase order.	0
O_K. Cool.	0
I handed it off to her about a  month  ago.	0
I  see.	0
O_K, so,	0
topic of this meeting is I wanna talk a little bit about transcription.	0
Um, I've looked a little bit into  commercial  transcription services and Jane has been  working  on doing transcription.	0
Uh, and so we wan- wanna decide what we're gonna do with that  and then get an update on the  electronics,	0
and then, uh, maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools, and so on.	0
Um, you know, eventually we're probably gonna wanna distribute this thing and we should decide how we're gonna -	0
how we're gonna handle some of these factors.	0
So.	0
Distribute what?  The data?	0
Hmm?	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
I mean, so we're - we're collecting a corpus and I  think  it's gonna be generally useful.	1
I mean, it seems like it's not a corpus which is - uh, has been  done  before.	1
And so I  think  people will be interested in  having   -  having  it,  and so we will -	0
Oh.	0
u- Using, like, audio D_V_Ds or something like that?	0
Yes.	0
Excuse me?	0
Audio D_V_Ds?	0
Well, or  something.	0
Yeah, audio D_V_Ds, C_Ds,	0
Or t-	0
you know.	0
Yeah.	0
tapes.	0
And - and so how we do we distribute the transcripts, how do we distribute the audio files, how do we -	0
how do we just do all that  infrastructure?	0
Well, I think - I mean, for that particular issue ther- there are known sources where people go to - to find these kind of things like the [MASK] for instance.	0
Yeah, that's right.	0
Right, but - but so should we do it in the same format as [MASK] and what does that  mean  to what we've done  already?	0
Right. The -	0
It's not so much the actu- The  logistics  of distribution are secondary to  preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution.	0
Right.	0
Right.  So, uh,	0
as it  is,  it's sort of a  ad-hoc combination of stuff  Dan  set and stuff  I  set up, which we may wanna make a little more formal.	0
And the  other  thing is that, um,	1
So.	0
University of Washington may want to start recording meetings as  well,  in which case	1
Right.	0
w- w- we'll have to decide what we've actually got so that we can	0
give  them  a copy.	1
A  field  trip.	0
That's right.	0
Yeah.  I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind spending the  summer  up there. That would be kind of fun.	0
Oh,  really?	0
Yeah.	0
Different for  you.  Yes.	0
Visit my friends and	0
spend some time -   Well, and then  also  I have a bunch of stuff for doing this  digits.	0
So I have a bunch of scripts with [MASK], and some Perl scripts, and other things that make it really easy to extract out  and align where the  digits  are.	1
And if [MASK] going to do the same  thing  I think it's worth while for them to do th	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And what I've done is pretty ad-hoc,	1
um, so we might wanna change it over to something a little more standard.	1
Hmm.	0
You know, [MASK], or [MASK], or  something.	1
An- and there's interest up there?	0
What's that?	0
There's interest up there?	0
Well they - they certainly wanna collect more data.	0
And so they're applying, I think [MASK]  Is that right?	0
I don't know.	0
Something like that.	0
Um, for some more money to do more data. So we were planning to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings.	1
They wanna do an additional  hundred  or so hours. So, they want  a   very  large data set.	0
Um, but of course we're not gonna do that if we don't get money.	0
So.	0
I  see.	0
And  I  would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint  room.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I mean, one of the things Morgan and I were talking about is we're gonna get to know this room really well, the - the  acoustics  of this room.	0
Including  the  fan.  Did you  notice  the  fan  difference?	0
All about that.	0
Including the fan.	0
Oh, now you've touched the  fan  control, now all our  data's  gonna be -	0
Hear  the  difference?	0
Yeah, it's great.	0
Oh,  that's  better.	0
Oh, it's enormous.	0
That's better.	0
Do you wanna leave it  off  or  not?	0
All  the  others  have been  on.	0
Yeah, the - You  sure?	0
That's -	0
Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.	0
You -  You think that -	0
y- Absolut-	0
things after the f- then  @@	0
Yeah.	0
This fan's wired  backwards  by the way.	0
Uh, I think this is  high  speed here.	0
Yeah, it's noticeable.	0
Well, not clear. Maybe it - Maybe it  isn't.	0
Well it's - well like  "low" is mid - mid-scale.  So it could be  that it's not actually wired backwards it's just that ambiguous.	0
That's right.	0
I was wondering also,	0
Get ready.	0
Uh-huh.	0
whether the  lights  made any noise.	0
There's  definitely   - Yep. High pitch hum. Wow.	0
Yeah, a little bit.	0
Oh, they  do.  Yeah.	0
So,  do our meetings in the dark with no air conditioning in the future.	0
Yeah, just get a variety.	0
I think	0
candles would be nice if they don't make noise.	0
They're very good.	0
Oh, yeah.	0
It would - you know, it would real- really mean that we should do short meetings when you  turn off the -	0
Carbon monoxide poisoning?	0
Short meetings, that's right.  Or -	0
turn off the air conditioning,	0
Yeah, sort of  r- r-	0
got to finish  this meeting.	0
Tear t-	0
Tear your clothing off to stay cool.	0
That's right.	0
Actually, the a- th- air - the air conditioning's still working, that's just an auxiliary fan.	0
Right, I see.	0
So, um, in addition to this issue about [MASK] there was announced today, uh, via [MASK], um, a corpus from I  believe  Santa Barbara.	1
So-	0
Yeah, I saw it. I've been  watching  for that corpus.	0
Um, of general spoken	0
Yeah.	0
English.	0
Yep.	0
And I don't know exactly how they recorded it but apparently there's a lot of different  styles of speech and what not. And -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
They had people come in to a certain degree and they - and they have [MASK]	1
I see. So it is sort of far field stuff.	0
I - I assume so, actually, I hadn't thought about that. Unless they added	0
Right?	0
close field later on but, um, I've  listened  to some of those data and I, um, I've been - I - I was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
I'm glad to see that it got released. So it- it's a very nice thing.	0
What's it sound like?	0
Yeah, I - I wish -	0
S-	0
I wish we had someone  here  working on  adaptation  because it would  nice  to be able to  take  that stuff and  adapt  it to a  meeting  setting.	1
How do you mean - do you mean mechanical adaptation or -	0
But it may be - it may be useful in -	0
You know -	0
No, software, to adapt the speech recognition.	0
O_K.	0
Well, what I was thinking is it may be useful in	1
transcribing, if it's far field stuff, right?	1
Mm-hmm.	0
In doing, um, some of our first automatic	1
Great idea.	0
That's true.	0
And - and their recording conditions are really clean. I mean, I've - I've heard - I've listened to the data. It sounds -  well but what I mean is that, um -	0
Well that's not good, right?	0
That's - that's not great.	0
Tr-	0
But far field means great distance? I mean -	0
Just these.	0
Not head mounted?	0
Yeah.	0
And so that's why they're getting away with just two channels or something, or are they using multiple [MASK]	0
Um, oh, good question and I can't ans- answer it. I don't know.	0
Well we can look into it.	0
No, and their web - their web page didn't answer it either. So I'm, I- uh, was thinking that we should contact them.  So it's - that's sort of a beside-the-point point. But.	0
O_K.	0
So we can get that just with, uh, media costs, is that right?	0
Still a point.	0
Right.	0
Uh, in fact we get it for  free  cuz they're distributing it through [MASK].	1
Oh.	0
Yep.	0
Great.	0
So that would be - yeah, that would be something to look into.	1
So, I can - I can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order if we're -	0
So.	0
The  other  thing  too  is from - from a -	0
Well, it's silly to do unless we're gonna have someone to work on it, so maybe we need to	0
think about it a little bit.	0
The other thing too is that their- their jus- their  transcription  format is really nice and simple in - in the  discourse  domain.	0
Huh.	0
But they also mentioned that they have  it  time aligned. I mean, I s- I - I saw that write-up.	0
Yeah.  Maybe we should - maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they  did  so - so that we can - we can compare.	1
Yeah, absolutely.	0
It's very nice.	0
Yeah.	0
Absolutely.	0
O_K, why don't you go ahead and do that then Eric?	1
Alright, I'll do that.	0
I can't remember the name of the corpus. It's Corps-	0
[MASK] Corpus of Spoken American English.	1
S_ - Right, O_K.	0
Yeah, sp-  I've  been - I was  really  pleased to see that. I knew that they -	0
they had had some funding problems in completing it but, um,	0
Yeah.  Well they're -	0
Uh-huh.	0
this is clever.	0
Apparently this was like phase one and the- there's still more that they're gonna do apparently or something like that unless of course they have funding issues and then	0
Got it through [MASK].	0
Great.	0
Great.	0
then it ma- they may  not  do phase two but	0
from all the web documentation it looked like, "oh, this is phase one", whatever that means.	0
Super.	0
Super. Great. Yeah, that - I mean, they're really well respected in the linguistics d- side  too  and the discourse area, and -	0
O_K.	0
So this is a very good corpus.	0
But, it- uh- it would also maybe help- be helpful for  Liz,  if she wanted to start working on some discourse issues, you know, looking at some of this data and then, you know -	1
Right.	0
So when she gets here maybe that might be a good thing for her.	0
Actually, that's another thing I was  thinking  about is that maybe  Jane  should talk to Liz,	1
to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked.	1
O_K.	0
Maybe we should have a big meeting meeting.	0
Sure, of course.	0
That would be a meeting meeting meeting?	0
A meeting meeting meeting.	0
Yeah.	0
Well this is the meeting about the meeting meeting meeting. So.	0
Oh.	0
Right.	0
Um.	0
But maybe we should, uh- find some day that Liz - uh, Liz and Andreas seem to be around more often.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So maybe we should find a day when they're gonna be here and -	0
and Morgan's gonna be here, and we can meet, at least this subgroup. I mean, not necessarily have the U_dub people down.	0
Well, I was even thinking that maybe we need to at least  ping  the U_dub -	0
We need - we need to talk to them some more.	0
to see -	0
you know, say "this is what we're thinking about for our  transcription ", if nothing else.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So, well w- shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then?  O_K, so   since  that's  what we're  talking  about.	1
Yeah.	0
Let's.	0
What we're using right now is a tool, um, from this French group, called [MASK] that seems to work very well.	1
Um,	0
so it has a, uh, nice useful [MASK]  and, uh,	1
Thi- this is the process of converting audio to text?	0
Right.	0
And this requires humans just like the -	0
Yes, yeah.	0
[MASK]	0
Right, right. So we're - we're at  this  point only looking for [MASK] So all - all - so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time,	1
and then write down what was said within it,  and identify the speaker.	0
And so the things we - that we know - that I know  I  want are  the text, the start and end, and the speaker.	1
But  other  people are interested in for example  stress  marking. And so Jane is doing primary  stress,	1
um, stress marks as well.  Um, and then things like repairs, and false starts, and,	1
filled pauses, and all that other sort of stuff,  we have to decide how much of that we wanna do.	1
I did include a glo-  uh, a certain first pass.  My - my view on it was when you have a  repair   then, uh -	0
it seems - I mean, we  saw,  there was this presentation in the - one of the speech group meetings about how -  and I think Liz has done some stuff too on that, that it, uh -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
that you get it bracketed in terms of like -  well, if it's parenthetical, which I know that Liz has worked on, then  uh -	0
y- y- you'll have different	0
prosodic aspects.  And then also  if it's a r- if it's a repair where they're - like what  I  just did,  then it's nice to have sort of a sense of	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Hmm.	0
the continuity of the utterance, the start to be- to the finish. And, uh, it's a little bit deceptive if you include the repai- the pre-repair part -	0
and  sometimes or of it's in the middle. Anyway,  so what I was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs  which isn't	0
uh,	0
very time-consuming.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I- is there already some sort of plan in place for how this gonna be staffed or done? Or is it real - is that what we're talking about here?	0
Well, that's part of the thing we're talking about. So what we wanted to do was have Jane do basically one meeting's worth,	1
you know, forty minutes to an hour, and -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
As a pilot study. Yeah, as a pilot study.	1
Yourself?  It - this is - this is like five times real time or ten times real time -	0
Yeah.	0
Ten  times about, is - and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take,	1
and then also what tools we would use. And so the next  decision  which has to be made actually  pretty  soon is how  are  we gonna do it?	1
And so you make Jane do the  first  one so then she can decide, oh, we don't need  all  this stuff, just the words are fine.	0
So.	0
That's right, that's right.	0
That's right.	0
I wanna hear about these - uh, we have a g- you were s- continuing with the transcription conventions for s-	0
R- right, so - so  one  -  one  option is to get	0
linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it. And apparently that's happened in the past.  And I think that's  probably  the right way to do it.	1
Um, it  will  require a post pass, I mean people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it's been  done  correctly,	0
but I just can't  imagine  that we're gonna get anything  that  much better from a commercial one.	1
And the commercial ones I'm sure will be much more expensive.	0
Can't we get Joy to do it all?	0
No,  that's -	0
Yeah right.	0
We will just get Joy and Jane to do everything.	0
Is tha- wasn't that what she was doing before?	0
Yeah, that's right.	0
But, you know, that's what we're  talking  about is getting some slaves who - who need  money  and, uh,	0
Right.	0
duh, again  o-	0
I  object  to that characterization!	0
Oh, really.	0
I  meant  Joy.   And so again, I have to say "are we  recording " and then say, uh, Morgan has - has consistently	0
Oh, thank you. O_K.	0
resisted  telling me how much money we have.	0
Right. Well, the answer is  zero.  There's a reason why he's resisted. But.	0
So.	0
Well, if it's zero then we can't do any transcription. I mean, cuz we're - we -	0
Right.	0
I have such a hard  name.	0
I mean, I - I can't imagine  us  doing it  ourselves.	0
Well, we already - we already -  We already have a plan in place for the first meeting. Right? That's -	0
Right?	0
N- right.	0
Well th- there is  als-  Yeah, really.	0
There is also the o- other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks,	0
you can - you could get people to -	0
to um,	0
Well, i- b- but seriously, I - I mean, Morgan's obviously in a bind over this and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory,	0
Right.	0
to do it in exchange.	0
which is we- we go ahead as though there will be money at the time that we need the money.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And that's - that's the best we can do. i- b- To not do anything until we get money is - is ridiculous.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
We're not gonna do any - get anything done if we do that.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
So at any rate, Jane was looking  into  the possibility of getting  students,  at - is that right? Talking to people about that?	0
I'm afraid I haven't made any progress in that front yet. I should've sent email and I haven't yet.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah, right. So, uh -	0
I- d- do - So until you actually  have a  little  experience with what this - this French thing  does  we don't even have -	0
And I  do  have -	0
She's already done quite a bit. Yeah.	0
I have -	0
Oh, we  have.  I'm sorry.	0
a bunch of hours, yeah.	0
So that's where you came up with the f- the [MASK]	0
Actually that's the - the one people usually use, [MASK]	0
Or is that really just a guess?	0
And I haven't really calculated - How fast am I?  I haven't done a s- see, I've been at the same time doing kind of a boot strapping in deciding on the transcription conventions that - that are -	0
How fast are you?	0
Yeah i-	0
Mmm.	0
you know, and - and stuff like, you know, how much -	0
Right.	0
There's some interesting human factors problems like,  yeah, what span of - of time is it useful to segment the thing  into  in order to	1
uh, transcribe it the most  quickly.  Cuz then, you know, you get like -  if you get a span of  five  words, that's  easy.	1
Yeah.	0
But then you have to take the time to  mark  it. And then there's the issue of  it's easier to -	0
Yeah.	0
hear it th- right the first time if you've marked it at a  boundary  instead of  somewhere in the  middle,  cuz then the [MASK] or whatever and -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And so I mean, I've been sort of playing with, uh, different ways of mar- cuz I'm thinking, you know, I mean, if you could get optimal  instructions  you could cut back on the number of hours it would take.	1
D- does uh - this tool you're using is strictly - it doesn't do any speech recognition does it?	0
Yeah.	0
No.	0
No, it doesn't but what a super tool. It's a great environment.	0
But - but is there anyway to - to wire a speech recognizer up to it and actually run it through -	1
That's  an interesting idea. Hey!	0
We've - we've thought about doing that but the recognition quality is gonna be horrendous.	0
Well, a  couple  things. First of all the  time  marking you'd get - you could get	1
Wow .	0
by a tool.  And so if the - if - if the issue really- uh, I'm think about the close caption that you see running by on - on live news casts. You know, yo-	1
That's true.	0
That's interesting.	0
Most of those are done by a person.	0
Yeah, I-	0
I know - I  know  that. No, I understand. And - in a lot of them you see typos and things like  that,  but it - but it occurs to me that	0
Mm-hmm.	0
it may be a lot  easier  to  correct  things than it is to do things from  scratch,  no matter  how  wonderful the tool is.  But if - if there was a way to  merge  the  two  -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, we -	0
Well, I mean, but sometimes it's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right - I mean, it depends on the error rate, right?	0
That'd  be fun.	0
I mean, we've talked about it but -	0
Well s- but - but again the timing is for fr- should be for free. The timing should be -	0
But we don't care about the timing of the words.	0
Well I thought you just - that's - said that was a critical issue.	0
No, uh the - the boundary -	0
We don't care about the timing of the  words,  just of the  utterances.	0
We cut it s- s-	0
We don't - we don't know, actually. We haven't decided which - which time we care about, and that's kind of one of the things that you're saying, is like -	1
boundary.	0
you have the option to put in more or  less  timing data -	1
and, uh, be- in the absence of more specific instructions,	1
we're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is.	1
Yeah, so - so what - what she's done  so  far, is sort of -	1
more or less breath g-  not  [MASK]  sort of phrases,	0
Yeah.	0
continuous phrases.	1
And so, um,  that's  nice because you - you separate when you do an extract, you get a little silence on either end. So that seems to work really well.	1
That's ideal.  Although I was - I - you know, the alternative, which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time,  recently was,  um -	0
Um.	0
Yeah.	0
that, you know, ev- if it were like an arbitrary segment of time -	0
i- t-  pre-marked  cuz it does take time to put those markings in.	0
Yeah.	0
It's really the i- the interface is wonderful because, you know, the time it takes is you listen to it,  and then you press the return key.	0
But then, you know, it's like,  uh, you press the tab key to  stop  the flow	1
and -  and, uh, the return key to p- to put in a marking of the boundary.	1
But, you know, obviously there's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key so it's slightly delayed, so then you -	1
Yeah.	0
you listen to it a second time and move it over to here.  So that takes time.  Now if it could all be pre- marked  at some,  l- you know, good -	0
a-	0
i- a-	0
ar- but-	0
Are - are those d- delays adjustable?	1
Hmm.	0
Those delays adjustable?  See a lot of people who actually build stuff with human computer interfaces   understand  that  delay,	0
and - and so when you - by the time you click it it'll be right on because it'll go back in time to put the -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, uh, not in this case. It has other -	0
It could  do  that  couldn't  it.	0
We could program that pretty easily, couldn't we Dan?	1
Yeah, mis- Mister [MASK]	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, interesting point. Ah!  Interesting point.  O_K, that would make a difference.	0
I would have thought so, yeah.	0
Mmm.	0
But, um -	0
I mean, it's not bad but it does - take twice.	0
But, if we tried to do automatic speaker I_D.	0
I mean, cuz  primarily  the markings are at speaker change.	0
Yeah, yeah, but -	0
But we've got - we've got the most channel data. We'd have to do it from  your  signal.	0
But that would be -	0
Right.	0
Oh, good point! Ah!  We've got  volume.	0
I mean,	0
we've - we've got - we've got a lot of data.	0
Yeah, I guess the  question  is how much time will it really save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it.	0
Right.  but the chances are if we- if we're talking about collecting  ten or a hundred hours, which is going to take a hundred or a thousand hours to transcribe -	0
If -	0
But -	0
if we can go from [MASK] we're doing a big -	0
We're gonna need - we're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools,	0
Right.  So maybe -	0
Wow.	0
and  validate  the tools the do the d- to - to do all this anyway.	0
But - but it op-	0
If we're just doing [MASK] -	0
I knew you were gonna do that.  Just saw it coming.	0
I'm sorry. I wish you had told me - wish you'd told me.	0
Put - put it on your sweater.	0
At what part?	0
O_K,  I'm  alright.	0
Um, i- it  seems  like -	0
Well, uh, I don't know. Yeah. I mean, it - it's - it's maybe like -	0
a week's work to get to do something like this. So forty or fifty hours.	0
Could you get it so that with - so it would - it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker? And the - the format's really transparent. It's just a matter of	1
Right.	0
Sure.	1
Yeah.	0
a very c- clear - it's [MASK], isn't it?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
It's very - I mean, I looked at the -	0
the file format and it's just - it has a t- a time -	0
a time indication and then something or other, and then an end time or something or other.	0
So	0
maybe - maybe we could try the following experiment.  Take the data that you've already transcribed	1
Mm-hmm.	0
and -	0
Is this already in the past or already in the future?	0
Already in the past. She - she's done one - she's one -	0
You've already - you've already done some?	0
Yes I have.	0
She's - she's done about half a meeting.	0
Oh- Oh,  I  see. O_K, good.	0
Right. Right.  I'm go-	0
Right? About half?	0
S- I'm not sure if it's that's much but anyway, enough to work with.	0
Right.  Um,	0
Several minutes.	0
and - and throw out the words, but keep the time markings.	1
And then go through - I mean, and go through and - and try and re-transcribe it,	1
O_K.	0
Good idea.	0
given that we had perfect boundary detection.  And see if it - see if it - see if it feels easier to you.	1
O_K.	0
And forgetting all the words because you've been thr-	0
Yeah, that's what I was  thinking.  I'd - I'd be  cheating  a  little  bit g-  with   familiarity  effect.	0
Yeah, I mean uh, that's part of the problem is, is that what we  really  need is somebody else to come along.	0
Well, no, you should do it - you should do it -  Do it again from  scratch  and then do it again at the boundaries. So you do the whole thing  three  times and then we get -	0
No.	0
And then - then w- since we need some  statistics  do it three more.	0
Yeah.	0
Now, there's a plan.	0
O_K.  Oh, yeah. I'll do that tomorrow.	0
And so you'll get - you'll get down to [MASK] by the time you get done.	0
I should have it finished by the end of the day.	0
No, but the thing is the fact that she's - she's did it before just might give a lower bound. That's all. Uh, which is fine. It's -	0
Exactly.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
And if the lower bound	0
Right.	0
Well, uh- but there's an extra problem which is that I didn't really keep accurate -	1
uh, it wasn't a pure task the first time, so -	1
Oh!	0
uh, it's gonna be an upper bound in - in  that  case.  And it's not really strictly comparable. So I think though it's a good proposal to be used on  a   new  -	1
Yeah.	0
a  new  batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting.	0
Could use it on the next segment of  the  text.	1
The  point  we - where do we get the - the - [MASK] from?	0
Right.	0
Or the boundaries.	0
Yeah,  one  person would have to assign the boundaries and the - and the  other  person would have to -  I mean  that's  easy enough.  I  could do that.	0
Well, but couldn't I do it for the next -	0
We - we - we could get fake -	0
Oh, I see what you mean.	0
Well, but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a partic- specific channel wouldn't they?	0
That would be the automatic boundaries.	0
No, no, no, no. You wanna know - given - Given a perfect human segmentation, I mean, you wanna know how well - I mean, the - the question is, is it worth giving you the segmentation?	1
No, no.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah.	0
I mean, that - that's easy enough. I could generate the segmentation and - and you could do the  words,	1
Right.	0
and  time  yourself on it. So.	1
A little double-blind-ear kind of thing.	0
Yep.	0
I  see.	0
O_K.	0
So it - that might be worth doing.	0
That's good. I like that.	0
That would at least tell us whether it's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool, that will compute the segmentations.	1
And the thing to keep in mind  too  about this  tool,  guys is that  sure, you can do the computation for what we're gonna do in the  future  but if - if	1
Right.	0
[MASK] talking about doing two, or three, or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool, then obviously there's a real multiplier there.	1
Right.	0
And the other thing too is with - with  speaker  identification, if - if that could handle  speaker  identification that's a big	1
Well it w- I think it's pretty easy when we've got separate channels.	0
deal.	0
Well,  use  it. Yeah, that's why we s- bought the expensive microphones.	0
O_K. Yeah, I mean, that's a nice feature.	0
Right.	0
Yep.	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
That's a major - that's like, one of the two things that -	0
I mean, there's gonna - there's gonna be - in the meeting, like the reading group meeting that we had the other day, that's - it's gonna be a bit of a problem because,	0
O_K.	0
like,  I  wasn't wearing a microphone f- and there were  other  people that weren't wearing microphones.	0
Yes.	0
But you didn't say anything worth while anyway, right?	0
That  -	0
Right.	0
That'll s-	0
Yeah.	0
That's pretty much true but -	0
it might save ninety percent of the  work  though.	0
but, yes.	0
So.	0
So I - I need to - we need to look at what - what the final output is but it seems like	1
we - it doesn't - it seems like it's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate	0
the	0
phrase marks, and the speaker, and speaker identity without putting in the words.	1
Yeah. I've already become pretty familiar with the format, so it would be easy.	0
That'd be so great.	0
Yeah. Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
We didn't finish the -	0
If you'd tell me where it is, huh?	0
the part of work already completed on this,	0
did  we? I mean, you -  you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and, I guess you've mentioned in your progress report, or  status  report, that you had written a script to convert it into -	0
So,  I - when I - i- the - it's quickest for me in terms of	0
the  transcription  part  to say  something like, you know, if -  if Adam spoke to, um -	0
to just say, "A_ colon",	0
Like who could be, you know, I mean at the beginning of the line.	0
Mmm.	0
and E_ colon  instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing, uh, indicating the speaker I_D.	0
So, and then he has a script that will convert it into the - the thing that, uh, would indicate speaker I_D.	1
If that's clear.	0
It's pretty cute.  But at  any  rate. So, um,	0
O_K.	0
It's Perl script.	0
Right. So - so I think the guess at [MASK] seems to be pretty standard.	0
Everyone -  more  or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Using wh- using stone age-	0
using stone age tools.	0
That's right.	0
Using - using stone age tools.	0
Yeah, well that's true, but -	0
I mean, I looked at [MASK] which is a service that you send an audio file, they d	1
And then they - they do a clean up.	1
But it's gonna be  horrible.  They're  never  gonna be able to do a  meeting  like this.	1
What - i- just approximately, what did you find out in terms of price or - or whatever?	0
Right.	0
No.	0
Well, for [MASK] they don't quote a price. They want you to call and - and talk. So for  other  services,	0
um, they were about thirty dollars an hour.	0
Of - of tape?	0
Or of action? O_K.	0
Thirty - So, yeah. For thirty dollars an hour for - of their  work.	0
O_K. Oh, of their - Oh!	0
So - so if it's ten times it's three hundred dollars an hour.	0
So that's three - that's  three  hours.	0
D- did you talk to anybody that does closed captioning for - for uh, T_V?	0
O_K.	0
Right.	0
No.	0
Cuz they a- usually at the end of the show they'll tell what the name of the company is, the captioning company that's doing it.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Interesting.	0
Yeah, so - so my - my search was pretty cursory. It was just a net search.	0
And, uh, so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff	0
Well, you know, the - the thing - the thing about this is thinking	0
through that.	0
kind of, maybe a little more globally than I  should  here but	0
that really this could be a big contribution we could make.	0
Uh, I mean, we've been through [MASK] thing, we know what it - what it's like to - to manage the - manage the process, and admittedly they might have been looking for more detail than what we're looking for here but	0
it was a - it was a big  hassle,  right? I mean, uh, you know, they - they constantly  could've  reminding people and going over it.	0
Yeah.	0
And clearly some new stuff needs to be done here.  And it's - it's only	0
our time, where "our" of course includes  Dan,   Dan and you guys. It doesn't include me at all.  Uh.	0
j- Just seems like -	0
Yeah, I mean I don't know if we'd be able to do any thing f- to help [MASK]	0
problems. But certainly for  this  problem we can do a lot better than -	0
Bec-	0
Why? Because they wanted a lot more  detail?	0
No. Because they had - because they only had two  speakers,  right? I mean, the - the [MASK] is -	0
Right.	0
Only had two.	0
Trivial.	0
They had  two  speakers over the  telephone.	0
Oh,  I  see. So what took  them   so long?	0
Um,  mostly  because they were doing much lower level  time.  So they were doing phone and  syllable	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
transcription, as well as, uh,  word  transcription.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And so we're - w- we decided early on that we were  not  gonna  do  that.	0
I see.	0
But there's still the same issue of managing the process, of -  of reviewing and keeping the files straight, and all this stuff, that - which is clearly a hassle.	0
Yep.	0
Yeah.	0
Right. And so - so what I'm  saying  is that if we hire an external service I  think  we can expect three hundred dollars an hour.	1
Yeah.	0
I think that's the ball park. There were several different companies that -  and the - the range was very tight for technical documents. Twenty-eight to thirty-two dollars an hour.	0
And who-	0
who knows if they're gonna be able to m- manage multal- multiple channel data?	1
Yeah, they won't. They w- they'll refuse to do it. Yeah.	0
They  won't.  We'll have to mix them.	1
Mm-hmm.  And then there's the problem also that -	0
Right.	0
No, but I mean, they - they - they won't - they won't - they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material.	0
That's not what they're d- quoting for, right?	0
Yes, it is.	0
Well, they might -  they might quote it -	0
For quoting meetings?	0
Sev- several of them say that they'll do meetings, and conferences, and s- and so on. None of them specifically said that they would do  speaker  I_D,	0
Wow.	0
Yeah.	0
or  speaker  change mark. They all just said transcription.	0
Th- th- the- th- there may be just multiplier for five people costs twice as much and for ten people co-   Something  like  that.	0
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	0
Well, the - the way it worked is it - it was scaled. So what they  had  is,	0
if it's an easy task it costs twenty-four dollars an hour and it will take maybe five or six times real time.	0
And what they said is for the hardest tasks, bad acoustics, meeting settings, it's thirty-two dollars an hour and it takes about ten times real time.	0
I see.	0
So I think that we can count on that being	0
about what they would do. It would probably be a little more because we're gonna want them to do  speaker  marking.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
A lot of companies I've worked for y- the, uh -	0
So.	0
the person leading the meeting, the executive or whatever, would sort of go around the room and -	0
and mentally calculate h- how many dollars per hour this meeting was costing, right?	0
In university  atmosphere you get a little different thing. But	0
you know, it's a lot like, "he's worth fifty an hour, he's worth -"	0
And so he-	0
so  here  we're thinking, "well let's see, if the meeting goes another hour it's going to be another thousand dollars." You know? It's -	0
So  ch-   So every- everybody ta- Talk really fast.  Let's get it over with.	0
Yep, we have to have a short meeting. Stop talking!	0
That's very interesting.	0
Yeah.	0
Talk  slowly but with few words.	0
And clearly.	0
That's right.	0
And	0
only  talk when you're  pointed  to.	0
There you go.	0
[MASK] only.	0
We could have some telegraphic meetings.  That  might be interesting.	0
Yeah, it'd be cheap. Cheap to transcribe.	0
@@	0
So. But at any rate, so we - we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out.	1
And we're talking about do- doing  how  many hours worth of meetings?	0
Thirty or forty.	0
So thirty or forty thousand dollars.	0
Yeah.	0
Well, for ten thousand dollars.	0
So, meanwhile -	0
Oh. What - Well, it was thirty times -	0
Three hundred.	0
Three hundred dollars an hour. Right.	0
Oh, I'm sorry, three hundred. Right, I w- got an extra factor of three there. Yeah.	0
So it's thirty dollars an hour, essentially, right? But we can pay a graduate student	1
seven dollars an hour. And the question is what's the difference - or ei- eight dollars. What - do you know what the going rate is? It's - it's  on the order of eight to ten.	1
How - how much lower are they?	0
I think uh- that would give us a - a good - good estimate.	0
I think.	0
But I'm not sure.	0
I'd - I'd say - yeah, I was gonna say eight - you'd say ten?	0
Ten.	0
Let's say ten.	0
Yeah, give  them   a break.	0
The- these are not for engineering graduate students, right?	0
Cuz it's easier.	0
Right, these are linguistics grad students.	1
That's right.	0
Yeah, I - I - I don't - I don't know what the - I don't know what the standard - but there is a standard pay scale I just don't know what it is.	0
Six.	0
Yeah, that's right. That's right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um,	0
so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it's cheaper to -	1
to do graduate students.	1
And there's another aspect too.	0
I mean, that's why I said originally, that I couldn't imagine sending it out's gonna be cheaper.	1
No, it isn't. So.	0
The other thing too is that, uh, if they were linguistics they'd be -	1
you know, in terms of like the post editing, i- uh - tu- uh content wise they might be easier to handle cuz they might get it more right the first time.	1
And also we would have control	1
of - I mean, we could give them feedback. Whereas if we do a service it's gonna be limited amount.	1
Mmm. Good point.	0
Yep, yep.	0
I mean, we can't tell them, you know, "for this meeting we really wanna mark stress and for this meeting we want -"	0
Yep.	0
No .	0
Good point.	0
And - and they're not gonna provide - they're not gonna provide stress, they're not gonna re- provide repairs, they're not gonna	1
provide - they - they may or may  not  provide speaker I_D.	1
So that we would have to do our own tools to do that. So -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Just hypoth- hypothetically assuming that - that we go ahead and ended up using graduate students. I- who - who's the person in charge? Who's gonna be the Steve here? You?	1
I just -	0
I  hope  it's Jane. Is that alright?	1
Oh, interesting.	0
Um, now would this involve some manner of	0
uh, monetary compensation or would I be the voluntary, uh, coordinator of multiple transcribers for  checking ?	0
Um, I would imagine there would be some monetary involved but we'd have to talk to Morgan about it.	0
Yeah, out of - out of Adam's pocket.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
You know , it just means you have to stop working for Dave.	0
Oh, I don't wanna stop working for Dave.	0
See? That's why Dave should have been here.  To pr- protect his people.	0
Oh, cool. Yeah.	0
Well, I would  like  you to do it because you have a lot more  experience  than I do, but if - if that's not  feasible,   I  will do it with you as an  advisor.	0
Uh-huh.	0
W- we'd like you to do it and we'd like to pay you. Not being Morgan though, it's -	0
We'll  see.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Oh, I see.  Well -	0
We'd  like  to. Unfortunately -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, six dollars an hour.	0
Yeah.	0
And - and then -	0
Yeah, I see. O_K.   Boy, if I wanted to increase my income I could start  doing  the transcribing again.	0
That's a -	0
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.	0
an- an- an- and be- and be sure and say, would you like fries with that when you're thinking about your pay scale.	0
I see. Good.	0
Yeah, no, that - I - I would be interested in that - in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that - more. Yeah. Uh-huh.	1
O_K.	0
More.	0
Yeah.	0
Um, any more on transcript we wanna talk about?	0
What s- so what are you - so you've done some portion of the first meeting. And what's your plan? To carry on doing it?	0
Yes. Mm-hmm.	0
What - Well, you know what I thought was right now we have p- So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions. He made his, uh, suggestion of improvement. The - the - It's a good suggestion.	0
O_K.	0
So as far as I'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now.	1
And so my next plan would be -	0
What - what do they -	0
what do they cover?	0
They're very minimal. So,  it would be good to - just to summarize that.  So, um,  one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change,	1
Yeah.	0
and this is a way which meshes well with - with, uh, making it	0
Yeah.	0
so that, uh, you know, on the - At the - Boy, it's such a nice interface. When you - when you get the, um - you - you get the [MASK] you also get  down  beneath  it,	0
an indication of,  uh, if you have two speakers overlapping in a s- in a single segment, you see them  one - displayed one  above  each other.	0
And then at the  same  time  the top s- part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing. You can clip - click on individual utterances and it'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal, and play it for you.	0
And you can, eh- you can work pretty well between those two - these two things.	0
Is there a limit to the number of speakers?	0
Um, the user interface only allows two.	1
Hmm.	0
And so if - if you're	1
using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two. But my script can handle  any.  And their  save  format can handle any.	1
And so, um, using this - the convention that Jane and I have discussed, you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want.	0
Do y-  is this a, uh, university project?	0
Th- this is the French software, right?	0
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, their academic.	0
Yeah, French. Yeah. And they're - they've been quite responsive. I've been exchanging emails on various issues.	0
eh-	0
Oh.	0
Oh,  really?	0
Uh , did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers?	1
Yes, and they said that's on - in - in the works for the next version.	1
Good.	0
Good.	0
Oh, so multi- multichannels.	0
Multichannels was also -  Well, they said they wanted to do it but	0
that the code is really very	0
organized around single channels. So I think that's n-  unlikely  to ha- happen.	0
I see.	0
O_K.	0
Do- do you know what they're using it for? Why'd they develop it? Are they linguists?	0
For this exact task?	0
For transcription.  It's -	0
But I mean, are they - are they linguists or are they speech recognition people?	0
Ho-	0
I think they're linguists.	0
Hmm.	0
Linguists.	0
They're - they have some connection to [MASK] cuz [MASK] has been advising them on this process, the Linguistic Data Consortium.	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um, so -	0
but a- apart from that.  Yeah .	0
It's also - All the source is available. So.	0
Right.	0
Great.	0
If you - if you speak [MASK]	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And they have - they've actually asked if we are willing to do any development and I said, well, maybe.	1
Good.	0
Right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So if we want - if we did - if we did something like programmed in a delay, which actually I think is a great idea, um, I'm sure they would want that incorporated back in.	1
Yeah, I do too.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Their pre-  pre-lay.	0
Pre-lay.	0
Pre-lay.   Well, and they've thought about things. You know, I mean, they - they do have -	0
Way.	0
So you have - when you - when you play it back,	0
um, it's - it  is  useful to have, uh, a - a  break  mark to - se- segment it.	0
But it wouldn't be strictly necessary cuz you can use the - uh, the tabbed key to toggle	0
the sound on and off. I mean, it'll stop the s- speech you know if you- if you press a tab.  And, um.	0
And so,	0
uh, that's a nice feature.  And then also once you've put a  break  in then you have the option of  cycling through the unit.	0
You could do it like multiply  until you get  crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit.  Or - or -  or -	0
Loop it?	0
Yo- you n- you know, there's al- also the - the user interface that's  missing.  It's missing from  all  of our offices, and that is some sort of  analog  input for something like this.  It's what	0
audio people actually  use  of course. It's something that wh-	0
when you move your hand  further,  the sound goes  faster  past it, like fast forward.	0
You know, like a joy stick or a - uh, you could wire a mouse or trackball to do something like that.	0
Why, that's -	0
That's not something I wanted to have happen.	0
No, but I'm saying if this is what professionals who actually  do  this kind of thing for - for - for - m- for video or for audio -	0
I see.	0
where you - you need to do this, and so you get very good at sort of jostling back and forth, rather than hitting tab, and backspace, and carriage return, and enter, and things like that.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Mmm.	0
Mmm.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog -  So  I mean, tho- those are things we could do but	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I - I just don't know how much it's worth doing. I mean we're just gonna have -	0
Ye- Yeah. Right.	0
Yeah, I - I agree. They - they have several options. So, uh, you know, I mentioned the  looping  option. Another option is it'll  pause  when it reaches the end of the  boundary.	0
Yeah.	0
And then to get to the next boundary you just press tab and it goes on to the next unit. I mean, it's very nicely thought out. They thought about - and also it'll  go around the c- the, uh,	0
Hmm.	0
Cool.	0
Hmm.	0
I wanna say cursor but I'm not sure if that's the right thing.	0
Point, whatever.	0
Anyway, you can - so they thought about different ways of having windows that you c- uh work	0
within,  and - But so in terms of the con- the conventions, then,  uh, basically,  uh,  it's  [MASK] which means with some w-	1
Mm-hmm.	0
provisions for, uh,	0
w- uh,  colloquial forms. So if a person said, "cuz" instead of "because" then I put a -  an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in - in double ang- angle brackets	1
Mm-hmm.	0
what the full lexical item would be. And this could be  something that was handled by a table or something but I think	0
to have a convention marking it as a non-standard	0
or wha- I don't mean  standard  - but a - a - a non-  uh, ortho- orthographic, uh, whatever.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Non-canonical.	0
"Gonna" or "wanna",  you know, the same thing. And - and there would be limits to how much refinement you want in indicating something as non-standard pres- pronunciation.	0
How are you handling [MASK]	1
[MASK] Um,	0
Comments.	0
you know - oh, yes, there was some -  in my view,	0
when i- when you've got it [MASK]	0
um,	0
I didn't worry about -	0
What do you mean by  du-	0
I didn't worry about s- specific start times. I sort of thought that	0
this is not gonna be  easily processed anyway and  maybe I shouldn't spend too much time getting exactly  when  the person said  "no", or, you know,	0
uh, i- "immediate".  And instead just sort of rendered "within this time slot,	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
there were two people speaking during part of it and  if you want more detail, figure it out for yourself",	0
Mm-hmm.	0
was sort of the way I felt  @@  -	0
I see.	0
Well, I think what - w- what Eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech, right?	0
Well, yeah, what I mean is wh- I mean, when somebody says "uh-huh" in the middle of, uh, a  @@  -	0
Yep.	0
Uh-huh. That happened very seldom.	0
Oh, cuz I was - I was listening  to  -  Dan  was agreeing a lot to things that you were saying as you were talking.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Oh, well, thank you Dan. Appreciate it.  Well, if it - if there was a word like "right",	1
So.	0
Yeah, there's an overlapping mark.	0
And -	0
you know, then I wou- I would indicate  that it happened within the same tem- time frame but wouldn't say exactly when it happened.	1
Yeah.	0
I'll be right back.	0
I see.	0
I transcribed a  minute  of this stuff and there was a  lot  of overlapping. It was -	1
A lot of overlapping, yeah.	0
Well there- there's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Huge  amounts. Um, when - when no one i- when we're not actually in the  meeting,   and we're all sort of separated, and - and doing things.	0
It was at the beginning.	0
But even  during  the meeting there's a lot of overlap but it - it's marked pretty  clearly.	0
Um, some of the backchannel stuff Jane had some  comments  -	0
and - but I think a  lot  of them were because you were at the meeting.	0
And so I think that - that often -	0
Yeah, well that's true. That's another issue.	0
often you can't tell. I mean, Jane had - had comments like	0
Yeah.	0
uh,	0
to - who - who the person was speaking to.	0
Yeah.  Only when it was otherwise gonna be puzzling because he was in the other room talking.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, but someone who, uh,  was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that.	0
Yeah.	0
That's true.	0
Right.	0
Or when Dan said, "I wa- I wasn't  talking  to  you ".	0
I know.	0
So you take a bathroom break in the middle and - and keep your head mount- Oh, you do?	0
You have to turn off your mike.	0
Yeah.	0
Well he was so - so he was checking the  meter  levels and - and we were handling things while he was labeling the - the whatever it was, the P_D_A?	0
You don't  have  to.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Uh-huh.	0
@@	0
And - and so he was - in - sort of - you were sort of talking -	0
you know, so I was saying, like -  "and I could label this one left. Right?" And he - and he said, "I don't  see  anything".	0
And he said -  he said,  "I wasn't talking to you".  Or - it wasn't - it didn't sound quite that rude. But really, no, uh - w- you know in the context if you know he can't hear what he's saying -	0
But -	0
but when you w- when you  listen  to it -	0
he- he-	0
It was a lot funnier if you were there though.	0
Uh, yeah, I know. Well, you'll see. You can listen to it.	0
Well what - what it - what happens is if you're a transcriber listening to it it sounds like Dan is just being a total -	0
Oh, I thought it was  you  who was.	0
totally   impolite.	0
No, well, but you were - you were asking off the wall questions.	0
Um -	0
But - but if you  knew  that - that I wasn't actually in the  room,  and that Dan wasn't talking to  me,	0
it - it became O_K. So.	0
I see.	0
So th-	0
And that's w- that's where I added comments. The rest of the time I didn't bother with who was talking to who but - but this was unusual circum- circumstance.	0
Hmm.	0
So this is - this is gonna go on the meeting meeting transcriber bloopers tape, right?	0
Yes. Right.	0
Well and part of it was funny, uh - reason was because it was a  mixed  signal so you couldn't get any clues from	0
Stereo. Yeah.	0
volume   that, you know, he was really far  away  from  this  conversation. You couldn't do that symmetrically in any case.	0
No.	0
Oh. I should rewrite the  mix  tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other.	0
That's  a good idea.	0
I have a  auto-gain-mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal and that seems to work really well for the uh  transcribers.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Great.	0
But I thought it would be - you know, I - I didn't wanna add more contextual comments than were needed but that, it seemed to me, clarified that the	0
con- what was going on.	0
And, uh -  O_K, so normalization -	0
So, s-	0
I was just gonna ask, uh, so I just wanted to c- sort of finish off the question I had about backchannels,	0
if that's O_K,  which - which was, so say somebody's talking for a while and somebody goes "mm-hmm" in the middle of it, and - and - and what not,	0
Yeah. O_K. Yeah.	0
Mmm.	0
does the	0
conversation	0
come out from the - or the person who's speaking for the long time as one segment and then there's this little tiny segment	0
of this other speaker or does it - does the fact that there's a [MASK]	1
the -	0
the - the - it in  two.	1
O_K, my - my focus was to try and maintain conten- con- content continuity	1
and, uh, to keep it within what  he  was saying. Like  I wouldn't say [MASK] bu	1
if someone said "mm-hmm" in the middle of a - of someone's,  uh,	0
uh, [MASK]  I - I indicated it as,	0
O_K.	0
like what you just did.	1
then I indicated it as a segment which contained	1
@@   this utterance plus an overlap.	1
O_K.	0
But that's - but there's only one - there's only one time boundary for both speakers, right?	1
Yeah, that's right.  And you know, it could be made more precise than that but I just thought -	1
I see, I see, O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
I think whenever we use these speech words we should  always   do the thing like you're talking about,  accent,    @@    @@ .	0
Oh,  I  see what you mean.	0
And then  "hesitation".	0
Yeah.	0
O_K, and so then, uh, in terms of like words like "uh" and "um" I just wrote them because I figured there's a limited number, and I keep  them   to a - uh, limited set because it didn't matter if it was "mmm" or "um",	1
you know, versus "um".  So I just always wrote it as [MASK]	0
And "uh-huh",	0
O_K.	0
you know, "U_H_U_H." I mean, like a s- set of like five. But in any case -  I didn't mark those.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
No. " Uh-huh " is "U_H_H_U_H_." "Uh-uh"  is "U_H_U_H."	0
I'd be happy with that. That'd be fine.  It'd be good to have that in the - in the conventions, what's to be used.	0
Huh-uh.	1
I - I  did  notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end. We should probably mark	1
areas that have no speakers as no speaker.	1
Yeah, that's a fine idea.	0
Then, so question mark colon is fine for that.	0
That's a fine idea.	0
Yeah, O_K. Yeah.	0
Well, what's that mean? You mean re-	0
Just say silence. No one's  talking.	0
ye- s- Oh. Silence all  around.  Yep.	0
Yep.	0
So I had -	0
We have to  mark  those? Don't they - d- can't we just leave them unmarked?	0
I d-	0
Well, you see, that's possible too.	0
Well, I wanna leave the marked - I don't want them to be part of another utterance.	0
O_K.	0
So you just - you need to have the boundary at the start and the end.	0
Sure.	0
Mm-hmm.  Now that's refinement that, uh, maybe it could be handled by	0
part of the - part of the script or something more -	0
Uh, yeah, it seems like -	0
it seems like the, uh, tran- the transcription problem would be very different if we had these	0
automatic speaker detection turn placing things.	0
Because suddenly -	0
I mean, I don't know, actually it sounds like there might be a problem  putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels.	0
But assuming we can get around that somehow.	0
Mm-hmm.  Well you were saying, I think it can  read  -	0
It can read and write as many as you want, it's just that it-	0
Uh-huh.	0
But what if you wanna edit it?	0
Right? I mean, the point is we're gonna generate  this transcript with five - five tracks in it,	0
but with no words.  Someone's gonna have to go in and type in the words.  Um, and if there are five - five people speaking at once,	0
Right, i- it's -	0
I didn't explain it well. If we use the - the little -	1
the conventions that Jane has  established,  I have a  script  that will convert from that convention to their saved convention.	1
Oh, yeah.	0
Yes.	0
Which  allows  five.	1
Right.	0
And it can be m- edited after the fact, can't it also?  But their - but their format, if you wanted to in- indicate the speakers right  there  instead of doing it through this indirect route,	1
Yes.	0
Yeah.	0
then i- they - a c- window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers.	0
Right.	0
But you're saying that by the time you call it back in to - from their saved format it opens up a window with- window with  five  speakers?	1
So. But.	0
Right.	1
Oh!  That  is  sort of  f-	0
They didn't quite go the whole -	0
It's just user interface. So i- it's -	0
Yeah, they didn't go the whole route, did they? They just -	0
the - the - the whole saved form- the saved format and the internal format, all that stuff, handles multiple speakers.	1
It's just there's no user interface for  specifying	1
Right.	0
multiple - any more than  two.	1
And that -	0
So your - your script solves - Doesn't it solve all our problems, cuz we're always gonna wanna go through this	1
Yep.	0
Yep.	0
preprocessing - uh, assuming it  works.	0
Yep.	0
And  that  works nicely cuz this so  quick  to enter. So I wouldn't wanna do it through the interface  anyway  adding which -  worry  who the speaker was.	1
Yep.	0
I see.	0
Right.	0
Good.	0
And then, uh, let's see what else.	0
Oh, yes, I - I wanted to have -	0
So sometimes a pers- I - uh- in terms of like the continuity of thought	1
for transcriptions, it's - i- it isn't just words coming out, it's like there's some	1
purpose for an utterance. And  sometimes someone will  do a [MASK] in the  middle  of it  but you wanna show that it's continued	0
at a later point. So I have - I have a convention of putting like a dash  arrow	1
just to indicate that this person's utterance continues. And then when it	1
uh, catches	0
back up again then there's an arrow dash, and then you have the opposite direction	0
to indicate continuation of ones  own  utterance versus,  um, sometimes  we had  the  situation which is -	1
you know, which you - which you  get  in conversations,  of someone continuing someone  else's  utterance,	1
and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde,	1
Mmm.	0
to indicate that it was continuation but it wasn't - Oh, I guess I did	1
equal  arrow for the - for the own - for yourself things cuz it's - the speakers the same.  And then tilde arrow if it was a different -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mmm.	0
if a different speaker, uh,	0
Oh.	0
con- continuation. But just, you know, the arrows showing continuation of a thought.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And then you could track whether it was the same speaker or not by knowing - you know, at the end of this unit you'd know what happened later.	0
And that was like this person continued and you'd be able to  look for the continuation.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
But the only time	0
So-	0
that becomes ambiguous is if you have two speakers.	0
Like, if you -  If you only have one person, if you only have one thought that's continuing across a particular time boundary, you just need	0
one arrow at each end, and if it's picked up by a different speaker, it's picked up by a different speaker.	0
The time it becomes ambiguous if you have	0
more than one speaker and that - and they sort of	0
swap. I guess if you have more than one thread going, then you -	0
then you need to know whether they were swapped or not.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
How often does that  happen  do you think?	0
Hopefully not very much.	0
Yeah, I didn't use it very often.	0
Especially for meetings.	0
It l- ou-	0
I mean, if i- if you were just recording someone's day, it would be impossible. You know, if you were trying to do a remembrance agent.	0
But I think for meetings it's probably alright.	0
Hmm.	0
But, a lot of these issues, I think that for -	0
uh, from  my  point of view, where I just wanna do speech recognition and information retrieval, it doesn't really matter. But other people have other interests. So.	0
Sure.	0
I know.	0
But it - it does feel - it does  feel  like it's  really in there . I - you know I did this - I did this transcription and I marked that, I marked it with ellipsis	0
because it seemed like there  was  a difference. It's something you wanted to indicate that it - that I - this was the end of the phrase, this was the end of	0
that particular transcript, but it was continued later.	0
And I picked up with an ellipsis.	0
Right.	0
Excellent. Yeah. Yeah.	0
I didn't have the equal, not equal thing.	0
Well that's - you know, I mean - I - that's why I didn't  I didn't do it n-  I mean, that's why I thought about it, and - and re-ev- and it didn't do - I didn't do it in ten times the -  the time.	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Well, so anyway, are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically? Is that something you want to do, Dan?	1
No. But it's something  @@  that I feel	0
No.	0
we definitely  ought  to do.	0
I also wanted to ask you if you have a time estimate on the part that you transcribed. Do you have a sense of how long -	0
Yeah, it took me half an hour to transcribe a minute, but I didn't have any - I didn't even have a -	0
O_K.	0
I was trying to get Transcriber to run but I couldn't.  So I was doing it by typ- typing into a text file and trying to fit - It was horrible.	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
So thirty to one's what you got? So that's a- new upper limit?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Well, I mean, that's - that's because you didn't have the segmentation help and all the other -	0
Is it  -	0
But I think for a first try that's about right.	0
So - so if we hired a who- if we hired a whole bunch of Dan's -	0
That's right.  a-	0
Yeah.	0
It was actually - it was quite - it was a t-	0
If we  hire an  infinite  number of Dan's -	0
And there's always a warm up thing of -	0
It'd b- a- a-	0
it w-	0
Are we gonna run out of disk space by the way?	0
Yeah.	0
No.	0
O_K, good.	0
O_K.	0
d- Doesn't it beep in the other room when you're out of disk space?	0
So -	0
Is there - Maybe we should s- consider also, um, starting to build up a web site around	1
No.	0
Web site!  That's  great!	0
all of these things.  I  know.	1
Dan's sort of already started.	0
We could have like business-to-business  E_commerce  as  well!	0
That's right. No, but I'm-	0
it would be interesting - it would be interesting to see -	0
Can we sell banner ads?	0
Get - get paid for click-throughs?	0
Yeah.	0
What a good idea, that's how we could pay for the transcription.	0
I want to introduce -	0
I - I want to introduce the word "snot-head" into the conversation at this point.	0
We can have -	0
You wanna word that won't be recognized?	0
You see, cuz - uh, cuz -	0
Exactly.	0
Oh, I don't think so.	0
Um. No. The r-	0
Hey, what about  me?	0
w- What - O_K.	0
You're  the one who raised the  issue.	0
No. Alright, see here's - here's - here's my  thought  behind it which is that,	0
Alright.	0
uh, the - the stuff that you've been describing,	0
Jane,	0
I gu- one has to,  of course   indicate,	0
um, i- is very  interesting,  and	0
I- I'd like to be able to - to pore through, you know, the - the types of tr- conventions that you've come up with and stuff like that. So I would like to see that kind of stuff on the web.	1
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	0
O_K, now, w- the alternative to a web site would be to put it in Doctor speech.	0
Yes.	0
Cuz - cuz what I have is a soft link to my transcription	0
Yes.	0
Either's fine.	0
that I have on my account but it doesn't matter.	0
We c-	0
We can do it all.	0
we can do it all!	0
O_K.	0
We can write -	0
Web site's nice.	0
Oh.	0
Yeah.	0
Then you have to t-	0
you have to do [MASK]	0
Web site's what?	0
We could actually -  maybe  we could use the T_C_L plug-in.	0
Oh, man.	0
Ooo!  He's committed himself to something.	0
Ow. See he said [MASK] and - and that's -	0
But he does such a good  job  of it. He should be allowed to - to, you know,	0
I know, I know.	0
w-  do  it.	0
I  know,  but that - but, I -  Right.  But I should be allowed to but -	0
If you just did a crappy job,  no- nobody would want you to do it.	0
I sh- I  shouldn't  be allowed to by m- by my own -	0
by my - according to my own priorities.	0
Alright. Let's look at it anyway. So definitely we should - we should have some kind of access to	1
And we have - we have quite a disparate number of	1
Yeah.	0
the data.	1
web and other sorts of documents on this project sort of spread around. I have several and Dan has a few, and -	1
Yes.	0
Ah!	0
Right, so we can add in links and stuff like that to other things.  The -	1
Nice.	0
Yep.	0
Well, yeah. Well so then th-	0
Try - try to s- consolidate. I mean, who wants to  do  that though?   No  one wants to do that. So.	0
the other side is, yeah.	0
Uh, right.	0
Yeah.	0
Right,  that's  the problem.	0
Why? What - what's - what's the issue?	0
Well, we could put - we could put sort of a disorganized sort of [MASK] -	0
No one owns the project.	0
No one  what?	0
No one owns the project.	0
Yeah, I own the project but I don't wanna do it.	0
No one  wants  to own the project.	0
Right.	0

"Wah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah."	0
b- but - but - but what are you - what are you talking about for web site hacking? You're talking about writing [MASK] right?	0
No -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, I - I'm talking about putting together all the data in a form that - that is	0
legible, and pleasant to read, and up to date, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.	0
But, is it against the law to actually use a  tool  to help your job go  easier?	0
Absolutely.	0
It's - it's absolutely against the law to use a tool.	0
I haven't found any tools that I like. It's just as easy to use - to edit [MASK] as anything else.	0
You y-	0
No kidding?	0
That's obviously not true, but you have -	0
It's  obviously  not true.	0
No, it- it- it's obviously true that he hasn't found any he  likes.  The question is what is - what's he  looked  at.	0
Right. That's true.	0
Which one do you use Jim?	0
I use something called [MASK]	0
Oh, that's right. I remember. Yeah.	0
And it -	0
Which produces also site maps.	0
it's- it- it's very powerful.	0
Now, I guess if I were - if I were doing more powerful - excuse me - more complex web sites I might want to. But	0
most of the web sites I do aren't that complex.	0
Well, would this be to document it also for outside people or mainly for in house use?	0
But.	0
No, I think in-	0
I think  both.	0
I think mostly internal.	1
That's right.	0
Mostly  in house.	0
O_K.	0
Well, yeah, but what does internal mean? I mean, you're leaving.	0
No, both.	0
People at [MASK] wanna look at it. I mean, it's - it's internal  until -	0
Right.  Internal  to the  project.	0
I see.	0
We could do an [MASK] which would accommodate those things.	1
I - I - I - I -	0
O_K, well, send me links and I wi- send me  pointers,  rather, and I'll put it together.	0
Wonderful.	0
I'm not - o-	0
O_K.  I'm not sure how - how	0
important that distinction is. I don't think  we should say,  "oh, it's internal therefore we don't have to make it very good".  I mean, you can say	0
No. No.	0
"oh - oh, it's internal therefore we can put data in it that we don't -	0
we don't have to worry about releasing".  But I think the point is to try and	0
be coherent and make it a nice presentation.	0
Right. I agree.	0
Yeah, it is true, that is - it benefits to -	0
Cuz you're gonna have  to wor-  do the work sooner or later.	0
That's right. I mean, it's the early on.	0
Yeah.	0
Even if it's just writing things up. You know?	0
Yep.	0
It's a great idea.	0
O_K, um, let's move on to electronics.	1
Ah. Great.	0
@@  d- we - we out of tape - out of disk?	0
No, we're doing - we're doing  great.	0
I - I was looking for the actual box I plan to use, uh, but I -	0
c- all I could - I couldn't find it at the local store. But this is	0

Nice.	0

Clink! Clink!	0
Let's see -  see what it does to the -  But  this  was the uh - just - just to review, and I also brought  this   along rather than the  projector  so we can put these on the table, and sort of	0
And - and crinkle them and -	0
w- push  them   around.	0
And th- "that" being a diagram.	1
What? What?	0
That - that's the six tables that we're looking at. These six tables here,	1
with - with little boxes sort of, uh, in the middle here. Which es- would -	1
O_K.	0
I see.	0
I mean, the - the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway. I'll- I'll show you the -  the cro- this is the table cross section. I don't know if people realize what they're looking  at .	0

Yes.  He  is.   Absolutely.	0
Well why  not?  I mean, cuz this is what's gonna  happen.	0
You got plenty of data.  I won't come to your next meeting.  And - and -	0
and you- So this is the box's -	0
Get your paper off my [MASK]	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, let - let the record show that this is exhibit two B_.	0
That's right.  "Or not to be".  Yeah, yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Uh, the box, uh - there's a half inch lip here. The box is an inch thick so it hangs down a half an inch. And so the - the two	1
head set jacks would be in the front and then the little L_E_D to indicate that that box is live.	1
The - the  important  issue about the L_E_D is the fact that we're talking about  eight  of these  total,  which would be sixteen channels.	1
And, uh, even though we have sixteen channels back at the	0
capture, they're not all gonna be used for  this.  So there'd be a subset of them used for - obviously j- just use the ones at this end for -	0
Hmm.	0
for  this  many. So -	0
Excuse me.   you'd like a - a way to tell whether your box is live, so the L_E_D wouldn't be on. So if you're plugged in it doesn't work and the L_E_D is off that's -	0
Right. All the lights.	0
that's a tip off.  And then the, uh -	0
That's good.	0
would wire the - all of the cables in a - in a bundle come through here and o- obviously collect these	0
cables at the same time. Uh, so this - this notion of putting down the P_Z_Ms	1
and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table or - or -	1
Right. Well, we  wanna  do that definitely. So.	1
Right.	0
Right. And so the -	0
you - we just epoxy them down or something.  Big screw into the table.	0
Velcro.	0
Uh, and even though there's eight cables they're not really very big around so my model is to get a - a -	0
Sleeve.	0
a- p- piece of - yeah, that - that stuff that people put with the little - you slip the	0
wires into that's  sort of shaped like that cross section.	0
Yeah.  I'm - I'm r- a- I'm going up and then I'm going down.	0
Oh. O_K, not just sleeve them all?	0
No.	0
And leave them loose?	0
That looks like a semi-circle.	0
Yeah.	0
It's like a - it's a sleeping policeman.	0
Sleeping pol-	0
Whoo!  Speed-	0
Speed bump! Speed bump.	0
Speed bump.  That's  good. There we go s-	0
Yeah, it's like a speed bum-  An-	0
A "sleeping policeman"!   Cool.	0
And they're ac- they're actually ext- extruded from plastic. They sorta look like this.	0
What is -	0
Oh.	0
What does that  mean?  Is it a speed bump?	0
That's the s- that's British for speed bump, yeah.	0
So that the wires go through here.	0
Oh, is that right? I never heard that. Ah!	0
Wow.	0
Yeah.	0
So.	0
That's really cruel.	0
O_K, so that -	0
s-	0
So it would c- basically go on the diagonal here.	0
It could go either way.	0
So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number?	0
Yeah.	0
I guess.	0
Uh, because the -	0
How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables?	0
Because they're  there.	0
Well, O_K, let me rephrase that. Why two each?	0
Oh, because then you don't have to just have  one  each. So that if t- if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box.	1
Yeah.	0
And to - See, thi- this is really the way people sit on this table.	1
O_K.	0
Th-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
Uh.	0
Dot, dot, dot.	0
Which means two at each station.	1
Well that - that's the way people sit. That's how many chairs are in the room.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, I'm just saying that for the recording.	0
Alright.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
O_K.	0
And  certainly  you  could  do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in.	0
Uh if - if you ha- if you had nothing else. Yeah.	0
But then none of these.	0
Right. N- none of these and no [MASK] then.	0
Right. Right. I agree.	0
Only if you had - Well it depends on  this  box, right?	0
Oh, true enough. And actually, at the m- my  plan  is to only bring eight wires out of this box.  This - this box -	1
Exactly.	0
Oh, I didn't understand - Oh, I see, I see.	0
That being the wiring box.	0
Thi- thi- thi- this box is a one off deal. Uh.	1
And, uh, it's function is to s- to, uh, essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires,	1
plus supply power to the microphones cuz the - the -	1
he- the, uh, cheap head mounteds all require low voltage.	1
So - so you'd imagine some sort of -	0
in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d- of these two and each of those one or what?	0
Well I w- I- I- the  simplest  thing I could imagine, i- which is  really,   really  simple is to - quite literally that these things plug  in.	0
Hmm!	0
What -	0
And  there's a - there's a plug on the end of each of these - these, uh, ei-	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
Each of the blue wires? Mm-hmm.	0
eight cables.  An- and there's only - there's only four slots that are -	0
But there are only four. Yeah.	0
you know, in - in the first version or the version we're planning to - to build. So  that - that was the whole issue with the L_E_D, that you plug it in, the L_E_D comes on, and - and - and you're live.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, then it comes on. I see, I see. O_K, good.	0
Now the - the -  the subtle issue here is that - tha- I - I haven't really figured out a solution for this. So, we- it'll have to be convention.	0
What happens if somebody unplugs  this  because they plug in more of something  else?  Well the - there's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you're really  not  being powered. So -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
th- there  will  be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people, uh, rewire things. But.	0
Right.	0
Yeah, I mean, we - I had that last time.	0
But  uh  there are actually -  that  you know, there's an extra - there's a mix out on the radio receiver?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So there are actually six  [MASK] on the back of the radio receiver and only five cables going in, I had the wrong five, so I ended up   not  recording one of the channels  and  recording the mix.	0
How interesting. D- did you do any recognition on the mix - mix out?	0
Hmm.	0
No.	0
Wonder whether it works any -	0
But I  subtracted  the four that I  did  have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the  @@ . Yeah.	0
Got the fifth? Cool.	0
You g-	0
Oh, how great.	0
And did it  work?  Did it sound good?	0
Is it - is -	0
It's not bad. It's not bad, yeah.	0
Ain't science wonderful?	0
Wow.	0
That's amazing.	0
Yeah.	0
So -	0
So what's the schedule on these things?	0
Wow.	0
But, you always -	0
Uh, well I was wrestling with th- with literally the w-	0
number of connectors in the cable and the -	0
the, uh,	0
powering system. And I -	0
I was gonna do this very clever phantom power and I decided a couple days ago not to do it. So I'm ready to build it.	1
Hmm!	0
Which is to say, uh,  the  neighborhood of a week to get the circuit board done.	1
Mm-hmm. So I think the  other  thing I'd like to do is, do something about the set up so that it's a little more presentable and organized.	1
See-	0
I agree.	0
And I'm - I'm just not sure what that is. I mean, some sort of cabinet.	0
Well I can build a cabinet. The - the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to  design  the cabinet.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
In other words, to figure out ex- exactly what the right thing is. That cabinet can - can go away. We can use that for - for uh kindling or something.	0
But if you can imagine what the right  form  factor is. Dan- Dan and I have sort of gone around on this, and we were thinking about something that opened up in the top	0
to allow access to the  mixer  for example.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
But there's these things sticking out of the mixer which are kind of a pain, so you end up with this thing that -	0
if- if you stuck the mixer up  here  and the top opened, it'd be - it'd be fine. You wouldn't necessarily - Well,	0
you s- understand what I'm -	0
the - the - you can - you can start - start s- sketching it out, and I can certainly build it out of oak no problem, would it - you know, arb- you know, arbitrarily amount of -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, I understand. So.	0
I need a desk at home too, alright?	0
Is that gonna be a better solution than just going out and buy one?	0
Well, the - as we found out with the - the thing that, uh, Jeff bought a long time ago to hold our stereo system	0
the stuff you buy is total crap. And I mean  this  is something you buy.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And - and - It's total crap.  Well, it's useless for this function.  Works fine for holding a Kleenex, but it -	0
And it's total crap.	0
Right, Kleenex and telephones.	0
Right.	0
Um, so yeah, I g- I guess it's just a question, is that something you wanna spend your time on?	0
Oh, I -	0
I'm paid for.	0
O_K, great.	0
I have no problem. No, but w- certainly one of the issues is - is the, uh -	1
Hmm?	0
is  security.  I mean, we've been - been - been lax and lucky.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Lax.	0
Yep.	0
Really  lucky with  these  things.  But they're not ours, so - the, uh - the  flat  panels.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, yeah!	0
I'm telling you, I'm just gonna cart one of  them   away if they stay there much longer.	0
Wow.  Tempting. Tempting.  Yeah.	0
Uh, let the record show at - uh  at f- four thirty-five  Adam Janin says -	0
Well w- yeah, exactly. We'll know - we'll know to come after.	0
So, um, j- uh,	0
then the  other  question is do we wanna try to do a user interface that's available out here?	1
Sorry?	0
Use- user interface -	0
Slipped - almost slipped it by Dan.	0
A user interface. I mean, do we wanna try to get a monitor?	1
Oh! Sure. Well of  course  we do.	0
Or just  something.	1
Oh.	0
And how do we want to  do  that?	0
You mean like see - see meter readings, from - while  sitting  here.	0
J- just so we see  something.	1
Wow.	0
How about	0
Yeah.	0
use the thing that um	0
[MASK]  doing.	0
Which is to say just	1
laptop with a wireless.	1
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.	0
Oh.	0
Which we'll borrow from them,  when we need it.	0
What's wrong with yours? If we bought you a - a -	0
Oh, a-  Applecard . Sure. Right. Yeah, you could use my machine.	0
Well -	0

Yeah. Yeah.	0
Right.	1
I don't know.	0
Y- I mean, we need - obviously need to clear this with [MASK] but, uh,	0
how tough can  that  be? There - it you'd - all you need's  web  access, isn't it?	0
W- we don't need  X_  access but I mean that's fine. That's - that's what it does, yeah.	0
In - in theory.	0
O_K, great, great.	0

But - uh- anyway	0
But the two t-	0
there are - there are abs- there are a bunch of machines at [MASK] that have those cards and so I think	0
if w- if it doesn't - we should be able to find a machine that  does  that.	0
I - I mean I know that  doesn't - don't - don't the important people have those little blue VAIOs that -	0
Well, uh, b- that - to me that's a whole nother. That's a whole nother issue.	0
Hmm. Hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
The - the idea of con- convincing them that we should use their network	0
Yeah.	0
i- is fairly straight forward.  The idea of being able to walk into their office and say, "oh, can I borrow your machine for a while", is - is - is a non-starter.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
I see.	0
That - I - I don't think that's gonna work.	0
So, I mean, either - either we figure out how to use a machine somebody already - in the group already owns,	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
a- a- and the idea is that if it's it perk, you know, it's an  advantage  not - not a  disadvan-	0
Absolutely.	0
or else we - we literally  buy  a machine	0
e- exactly for that purpose.  Certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time.	1
Yeah.	0
I - I - I - I'm - I'm not a big fan of doing things to the room that make the room	0
Yeah.	0
less attractive for other  people,  right? Which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the  way  and -	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
and, so- a monitor  sitting  here all the time you know people are gonna walk up to it and go, "how come I can't get, you know, Pong on this" or, whatev-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Well -	0
Right.	0
I've - I've borrowed the [MASK]	0
VAIO Sony thingy, and I don't think they're ever gonna want it back.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
You're kidding!	0
Well, the next conference they will.	0
So.	0
Sure.	0
Yeah.	0
But that  does  mean - so we can use that as well.	0
Well, uh, the - certainly, u- you should give it a shot first See whether	0
Mm-hmm.	0
you- you can get compatible stuff.	0
Uh, ask  them   what it costs. Ask them if they have an extra one. Who knows, they might have an extra  hardware s-	0
I'd trade them a flat panel display for it. Yeah.	0
Good.	0
What is the, um, projector supposed to be hooked up to?	1
Uh, the, uh - Tsk.  It's gonna be hooked up to all  sorts  of junk.	0
There's gonna be actually a - a plug at the front that'll connect to people's laptops so you can walk in and plug it in.  And it's gonna be con- connected to the machine at the back.	1
So we certainly  could  use that as - as a constant reminder of what [MASK] are doing. So people sitting here  are going	1
Huge [MASK]	0
"testing, one, two, three"!	0
It - a-	0
But I mean, that's another - that's another possibility that, you know,  solves  -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
That's an end-	0
But - but - but I think the idea of having a control panel it's - that's	1
there in  front  of you is really cool.	1
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
I think and uh, having - having it on wireless is - is the  neatest   way - neatest way to do it.	0
R-	0
As long as you d- as l- as long as you're not tempted to sit there and f- keep fiddling with the volume controls going, "can you talk a bit louder?"	0
I had -	0
Yeah.	0
I had actually  earlier  asked if I could borrow one of the	0
cards to do wireless stuff and they said, "sure, whenever you want". So I think it won't be a problem.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, cool.	0
And - and it's a - [MASK], right?	0
O_K.	0
Yep.	0
[MASK]	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
Is it with s-	0
It's - it really come down to the driver.	0
I mean -	0
Yeah.	0
Right, i- it'll - it'll work -	0
Right, I mean, and if - and if  his  doesn't work, as I said, we can use [MASK]	0
It'll work the first time.	0
I - I  trust  Steve Jobs.	0
Good.	0
Um, well, that sounds like a d- good solution one way or the other.	0
So -	0
So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you're gonna give some thought to cabinets?	0
Uh, y-  yeah.  We - we need to	0
Great.	0
figure out what we want. Uh -	0
We'd - I  think  -	0
Hey,  what  are those green  lights  doing?	0
They're flashing!	0
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Does that - it means - it means it's gonna explode. No.	0
Cut the red wire, the red wire!	0
Um -	0
When people talk,  it  - they go on and off.	0
This  -	0
So again, Washington wants to equip a system.  Our  system, we spent ten thousand dollars on equipment not including [MASK]	1
However, seven and a half thousand of that was the wireless mikes.	1
Uh, using - using  these  -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And it - and the f- the five thousand for the wires, so if I'm gonna do -  No.  It's a joke.  I have to do  -	0
Yeah, that's true but we haven't  spent  that, right?	0
But once we - once we've done the  intellectual  part of these,	1
uh, we can just knock them  out,  right? We can start -  we - you can make a  hundred  of them or something.	1
Cheap.	0
Oh, of the - of the boards? Yeah, yeah, sure, right.	0
And then we could - Washington could have a system that didn't have any  wireless  but  would  had - what's based on  these  and it would cost -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Peanuts.	0
[MASK] and a peanuts.	0
P_C and two thousand dollars for the A_-to-D_ stuff.	1
Yeah.	0
And that's about - cuz you wouldn't even need the  mixer  if you didn't have the - Oh th-	0
Right.	0
[MASK]	1
But anyway you'd save, on the seven - seven or eight thousand for the - for the wireless system. So actually that	1
might be attractive.	0
Right.	0
O_K, I can move my thumb now.	0
Good.	0
That's a great idea.	0
What?	0
It's nice - it's nice to be thinking toward that.	0
Oh, I thought like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer.	0
Well, actually  shorten  -	0
Yeah.	0
There's a speech compression program that works great on things like this, cuz if the dynamic range is  low  it encodes it with fewer bits.	0
And so most of the time no one's  talking  so it shortens it  dramatically.  But	0
if you talk quieter, the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better.  So.	0
Yeah.	0
Oh.	0
Hmm.	0
It also helps if you talk in a monotone.	0
Probably.	0
Constant volume all the time.	0
Oh, interesting.	0
And  shorter  words.	0
Shorter words.	0
Now, shorter  words   wouldn't - would induce more dynamics, right? You want to have -	0
Yeah, but if the words are more predictable.	0
How about if you just go  " uh"?	0
Huh.	0
That's  a long word!	0
Uh.	0
How do you spell that?	0
I don't know.	0
O_K, can you do one more round of digits? Are we done talking?	0
Well it's a choice - if we get a choice, let's keep  talking.	0
Sure.	0
Do we have more to talk about?	0
No,  I'm  done.	0
I'm  done.	0
Are you  done?	0
I'm  done, yeah.	0
I'm  done.	1
Dan  isn't but he's not gonna say anything.	0
But - you - you - you - there's a problem - a structural problem with this though. You really need an incentive at the end if you're gonna do digits again. Like, you know, candy bars or something, or -	0
I'll - I'll remember to bring M_ and M_'s next time.	1
or - or - or- or a little, uh - you know, toothbrushes like they give you  at   the d- dentist.	0
Mmm!	0
Or both.	0
Or both.	0
Sorry.	0
Eric, you and I  win.  We didn't make any  mistakes.	0
It's  harder  at the end than at the beginning.	0
We don't  know  that for  sure,  do we?	0
I should have mentioned that s- uh, to pause between lines but -	0
No, I know. I'm just giving you a hard time.	0
It's - it's only a hard time for the  transcriber  not for the speech recognizer.  Me.	0
Tha- tha-	0
But -	0
I also think you said channel four and I think you meant  microphone  four.	0
And I think that's a mistake.	0
Very good. So Eric, you win. But the other thing is that there's a - there's a colon for transcripts.	0
And there  shouldn't  be a colon.	0
Because see, everything else is stuff you fill  in.	0
Yeah, that's been filled in  for  you.	0
Right? Automatically.  But real-	0
But they're in order! They start, six, seven, eight, nine, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, eight, nine.	0
Where'd they  come  from?	0
Oh.	0
And they're in order because they're sorted lexically by the file names, which are - have the numbers in  digits.	0
And so they're actually - this is like all the - all utterances that were generated by speaker M_P_J or something. And then within M_P_J they're sorted by what he actually  said.	0
Oh.	0
Ugh!  I didn't know that. I should have  randomized  it.	0
Wow.	0
It doesn't  matter!  It's like - Cuz you said "six, seven, eight".	0
Well, we  think  it doesn't matter.	0
But the  real  question I have is that, why bother with these? Why don't you just ask people to repeat numbers they already know?	0
We  think  it doesn't matter. If I - if not I -	0
Oh, interesting.	0
Like phone numbers, you know, social security numbers.  I know.  I kn-	0
Cuz we have these writt- written down, right? That's why -	0
Because - Right. If we have it, uh -	0
Social security numbers.  Bank account numbers.  Passport numbers.	0
You can - you can generate -	0
we don't have to transcribe.	0
Credit card numbers, yeah.	0
We don't have to tran- Yeah,  please .	1
Yeah. That's a  great  idea.	0
Yeah, so you just  say  -  say your credit card numbers, say your phone numbers, say your mother's maiden name.	0
Bet we could  do  it.	0
You know pe-	0
Password to your account. Go on.	0
people off the street.  This  -	0
Alright.	0
Actually, this - I got this directly from another training set, from Aurora. So. We can compare directly.	0
Looks good. Looks like there were no errors.	0
I was - I - the reason I made my mistake was - Wa- was this - ?	0
What?	0
There were no - there were no direct driver errors, by the look of it,  which is  good.	0
Great.  O_K, the mike's off.  Thank you all.	0
Good news.	0
So I'm gonna stop it. Yeah, O_K.	0
O_K.	0
Mony  on the mike.	0
Uh-oh.	1
