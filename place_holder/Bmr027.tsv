of - of  how   my - my - the things that we're questioning were along the lines of how easy -	0

how much implication would there be that it's  likely  you're going to be changing something, as opposed to - That was the kind of dispute I was making before.	0

But, um, the  attorneys,  I - uh, I can  guarantee  you, the attorneys will  always  come back with - and we have to decide how	0
stringent  we want to  be  in these things,  but they will  always  come back with saying	0
that, um, you need to - you want to have someth- some paper trail or - which includes electronic trail -	0
that they have, uh, in fact  O_ K'd  it.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So, um,	0
I think that if you f- i- if  we send the email as you have and if there's	1
half  the people, say, who don't respond  at  all  by, you know, some period of time,	0
we can just make a  list  of these people and hand it to, uh -	1

Right.	0
Is - is this O_K? And would you please mail - you know, mail Adam that it  is,  if i- if it, you know, is or not."	1
So, you know, we can - we can do that.	0
The other thing that there's a psychological effect that -	1
at least for  most  people, that if they've responded to your email saying "yes, I will do it" or "yes, I got your email", they're more likely to actually  do  it   later  than to just  ignore  it.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And of course we don't  want  them to  bleep  things  out,  but it -	0
it's a little bit better if we're getting the -	0
their, uh, final response, once they've answered you  once  than if they never answer you'd  at al- at  all.	0
That's how these mailing houses work. So, I mean, it's not  completely  lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting  responses.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
You know, an official O_K from somebody  is better than no answer, even if they responded that they got your email.	1
And they're probably more likely to do that once they've responded that they got the email.	1
I also think they'd just simply  appreciate  it. I think it's a good - a good way of - of	0
fostering goodwill among our subjects.	0
Well, our  participants.	0
I think the main thing is - I mean, what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases. So they s- so - so - Tha- that's what they're paid to do.	0
Sending lots of spam.	0
Yep.	0
And so,  it  is  certainly possible that, uh, somebody's server would be down or  something  and they wouldn't actually	0
hear  from us, and then they find this thing is  in  there and we've already distributed it to someone. So,	0
what it  says  in there, in fact, is that they will be given an opportunity to blah-blah-blah,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
but if in fact - if we  sent  them something or we  thought  we sent them something but they didn't  actually   receive  it for some reason,	0
um, then we  haven't  given them that.	0
Well, so  how   far  do we have to go? Do we need to get someone's signature?	0
Or, is email enough? Do we have to have it notarized?  I mean -	0
I- i- i- em- email is enough.	1

Except that you know they got the mail.	0
Mm-hmm. That's right. I - I could get you on the notify list if you want me to.	0
Right.	0
I'm already on it.	0
For that directory? O_K, great.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So again,  hopefully,  um, this shouldn't be quite as odious	0
a problem  either  way, uh, in  any  of the extremes we've talked about because	1
uh, we're talking a pretty small  number of people.	1
W-	0
For  this  set, I'm not worried, because  we basically know everyone on it.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
You know, they're all more or less here or it's - it's Eric and Dan and so on.	0
But for some of the others, you're talking about visitors who are  gone from ICSI,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
whose email addresses may or may not work,	1
Oh.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and -	0
So what are we gonna  do  when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with?	1
I don't think, uh - They're so recent, these visitors. I - and - and I - they're also so -	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
They're prominent enough that they're easy to find through - I - I mean, I - I w- I'll be able to - if you have  any  trouble finding them, I really think I could find them.	1
Other methods?	0
O_K.	0
Yeah. Cuz it - what it - what it  really   does  promise here is that we will ask their permission.	0
Um, and I think, you know, if you go into a room and close the door and - and ask their permission  and they're not there, it doesn't seem	0
that that's the intent of, uh, meaning here. So.	0
Well, the qu- the  question  is just whether - how active it has to be.	0
I mean, because they - they filled out a contact information and that's where I'm sending the information.	1
Right.	0
And so far everyone has done email. There isn't anyone who did, uh,	0
any other contact method.	0
Well, the way ICSI goes, people, uh, who, uh, were here ten years ago still have acc-  have forwards to other accounts and so on. So it's  unusual  that - that they, uh -	1
Yeah.	0
So my original  impression  was that that was  sufficient,  that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't  accurate	1
Yeah.	0
Then they just come back.	0
All my files were still here.   Yeah.	0
that  we fulfilled our burden.	1
Same as us.	0
So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I  will  call the attorney about it. But, you know, hopefully we won't need to.	1
I just -	0
O_K.	0
I d- I just don't think we  will.	0
Alright.	0
For all the reasons that we've discussed.	0
So we'll - we'll see if we do or not.	0
Yep. And we'll see how many people respond to that email.	0
Yeah.	0
So far,  two  people have. So.	0
Yeah. I think very few people will and - and - and, you know, people - people see long emails about things that they don't think	0
is gonna be high priority, they typically, uh, don't - don't read it, or half read it.	0
Right.	0
Cuz people are swamped. But -	0
And actually, um, I - I -	0
didn't anticipate this so I - that's why I didn't give this comment, and it - I - this discussion has made me think it might be  nice	1
to have a follow-up email within the next couple of days saying "by the way, you know, we wanna hear back from you by [MASK]	1
and please -", and then add what Liz said - "please, uh, respond to - please indicate you received this mail."	0
Uh, or e- well, maybe even  additionally,  uh, um,	0
"Even if you've decided you have no	0
changes you'd like to make, if you could	0
Respond to the email.  Yep.	0
tell us  that ". Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm. It  is  the first time through the cycle.	0
Right. That would - that would definitely work on me. You know, it makes you feel m- like,	0
um,	0
if you were gonna p- if you're  predicting  that you might not  answer,  you have a  chance  now to  say  that.	0
Whereas, I - I mean, I would be much more likely  myself,	0
given all my email, t- to respond at that  point,  saying "you know what, I'm probably not gonna get to it" or whatever,	0
And the other th-	0
rather than just having  seen  the email, thinking I  might  get to it, and never really,	0
Yeah. I was -	0
uh,  pushing  myself to actually  do  it until it's too late.	0
I was thinking that it also  lets them  know  that they don't  have  to go to the  page  to   accept  this.	0
Right. R- Right. That's true.	0
Right.	0
I mean, I - I - Yeah. So that way they could -	0
they can  see  from that email that if they just write back and say "I got it, no changes",	0
they're off the hook. They don't have to go to the web page and -	0
Yeah.	1
I mean, the other thing I've learned from dealing with - dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth, uh, is, um,	0
Yeah. That's true.	0
if you say "you've got three months to do this review",	0
um, people do it, you know,	0
two and seven eighths months from now. If you say "you've got three  weeks  to do this review", they do - do it, you know, two and seven eighths  weeks  from now -  they do the review.	0
Right.	0
And, um -	0
So,	0
if we make it  a  little  less time, I don't think it'll be that much -	0
Well, and also if we want it ready by the  fifteenth,  that means we better give  them   deadline of the  first,	0
if we have any  prayer  of actually getting everyone to respond in time.	0
There's the responding part and there's also what if,	0
uh, I mean, I hope this doesn't happen,	0
what if there  are  a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes? Then	0
Right.	0
we actually have to deal with that if we want it to -	0
Mm-hmm. Some lead time.	0
Ugh!  Disk space, oh my god!  I hadn't  thought  about that.	1
By the way, has - has Jeremy signed the form?	0
O_K.	0
That for every meeting -	1
any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of.	1
Oh.	0
Just that  channel.  Oh, no. We have to do -	0
Can't you just do that  channel?	0
No, of  course  not. You need  all  the channels.	0
Yeah. You have to do  all  of them,	0
Oh.	0
as  well  as all of  these.	0
Do you have to do the other  [MASK]	0
Yeah.	0
Wow.	0
Yes. Absolutely. There's a  lot  of [MASK]	0
You have to do all - You  could  just do it in that  time  period, though, but I guess it's a pain.	0
Well -	0
Well, but you have to copy the whole file. Right? Because we're gonna be releasing the whole file.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah. You're right.	0
Well -  I - you know, I think at a certain point,  that  copy that has the deletions will become the  master  copy.	1
Yeah. It's just I  hate  deleting any data.	0
So I - I don't want - I  really  would rather make a copy of it, rather than	1
Are you del- are you bleeping it by  adding?	1
bleep it out and then -	1
Overlapping.  So,	1
it's - it's  exactly  a censor bleep.	1
So what I  really  think is "bleep"  and then I want to -	1
I- I-	0
I- I understand, but is - is it  summing  signals or do you  delete the old one and put the new one  in?	0
I delete the old one, put the new one in. There's  nothing  left of the original signal.	0
Oh, O_K. Cuz -	0
Oh. Cuz if you were  summing,  you could -	0
No. But anyway -  Yeah.	0
Yeah. It would be qui- quite easy to get it back again.	0
But -	0
And then w- I was gonna say also that the- they don't have to stay on the system, as you know, cuz - cuz the - the ones -	0
Then someday we can sell the  unedited versions.	0
Yeah.	0
Say again?	0
Once it's been successfully bleeped, can't you rely on the - ?	0
Or  we'll tell people the frequency of the beep and then they could subtract the beep out.	0
Encrypt  it.	0
You can  hide  it. Yeah.	0
Oh, yeah.	0
Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version?	0
Right. Exactly. I see.	0
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yep, that's true.	0
It wouldn't be that hard	0
See, this is good. I wanted to create some  side conversations in these meetings. So -	0
Yeah. You could  encrypt  it,	0
to hide it.	0
O_K.	0
You can use spread spectrum. Hide it.  Yeah, there you go.	0
you know, with a - with a two hundred bit -  thousand bit, uh -	0
Uh-huh.	0
Here we go.	0
Yeah. Yeah. Cuz we don't have enough asides.	0
I have an idea. You reverse the signal, so it - it lets people say what they said backwards.	0
There you go.	0
Then you have, like, subliminal, uh, messages, like.	0
Backwards.	0
But,	0
ha- you've seen the - this - the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments. Did you read that paper?	0
Yeah.	0
It wouldn't work. The speech recognizer still works.	0
No.	0
Yeah. And if you do it backward then -	0
Yeah.	0
H_- [MASK]  No, it's backward-forward.	0
That's cuz they use forward-backward.	0
Forward but backward. That's right. Good point.	0
A  point.	0
Uh.	0
Well, I'm sorry if I sound a little  peeved  about this whole thing. It's just we've had meeting after meeting after meeting a- on this and it seems like we've never gotten it resolved.	0
Well, but we never also - we've also never  done  it.	0
Hmm.	0
Uh.	0
So. Yeah.	0
If it makes -	0
So.	0
This is the first cycle. There're bound to be some glitches the first time through.	0
And, uh - and I'm sorry responding without, uh, having much knowledge, but the thing is, uh, I am, like, one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and - and stuff comes in as	0
Well, and that's exactly why I did it the way I  did  it, which is the  default  is if you do  nothing  we're gonna  release  it. Because,	0
Yeah.	0
you know, I have my   stack  of emails of to d- to be  done,	0
that, you know, fifty or sixty  long,  and the ones at the  top  I'm  never  gonna  get  to.	0
Right.	0
And, uh  So - so -	0
Move  them   to the bottom.	0
So - so the only thing we're missing is - is some way to  respond   to easily to say, uh, "O_K, go ahead" or something. Yeah.	0
Yeah, right.	0
So, i- this  is  gonna mean -	0
Just re-mail  them   to yourself and then they're at the bottom.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah. That's actually definitely a good point. The m- email doesn't  specify	0
Yeah.	0
that you can just reply to the email, as op- as opposed to going to the form and -	0
In -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
And it also doesn't give a - a specific - I didn't think of it.	0
S- I think it's a good idea - an ex- explicit time by which this will be considered	0
Yeah, release.	0
definite.	0
And - and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint.	0
Yeah. It's  converging.	0
This - um, I've seen this recently. Uh, I got email, and it -	0
Yeah. That's right.	0
i- if I use a [MASK] it actually	0
says, you know, click on this button to confirm receipt  of the - of the mail.	0
Hmm.	0
Oh,  that's  interesting.	0
So -	0
You - you can -	0
A lot of mailers support return receipt. But it doesn't confirm that they've  read  it.	0
It's like certified mail.	0
Could  do  that.	0
Right.	0
No, no, no. This is  different.  This is not - So, I - I know, you can tell, you know, the, uh, mail delivery agent to - to confirm that the mail was  delivered  to your  mailbox.  But - but, no. This was different.	0
Mmm.	0
Right.	0
Ins- in the  mail,  there was a -	0
Oh, just a  button.  Oh, yeah.	0
uh, th- there was a  button  that when you  clicked  on it, it would send,	0
uh, you know, a actual acknowledgement to the  sender  that you had actually  looked  at the mail.	0
Yeah. Unfor- Yeah, we could do that. But I  hate  that.	0
But it o- but it only works for, you know, MIME-capable - you know, if you use [MASK] or something like that for your n-	0
Yeah.	0
You might as well just  respond  to the mail. I mean	0
And -	0
And we actually need a  third  thing. It's not that you've  looked  at it, it's that you've looked at it and - and - and  agree  with  one  of the possible actions. Right?	0
Right.	0
No, no. You can  do  that. You know, you can put this button anywhere you want, and you can put it the bottom of the message and say "here, by - you know, by clicking on this, I - I agree -	0
Oh?	0
Oh, I see.	0
uh, you know, I acknowledge -"	0
That i- i- my first-born children are yours, and - Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Quick question. Are, um -	0
Well, I could put a U_R_L in there without any difficulty and  even pretty simple [MASK] can do that. So.	0
But why shouldn't they just  email back? I don't see there's a problem.  It's very nice. I - I like the high-tech aspect of it, but I think -	0
Yeah. Reply.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
No, no, no.  I actually  don't.  I'm just saying that	0
I appreciate it.	0
Well, I - cuz I use a  text  [MASK]	0
if ev- but I'm -	0
Don't you use [MASK]	0
for your mai- ?	0

Wow. That's - that's my guy. Alright.	0
You - you [MASK]	0

So - I - i-	0
There's these logos  that you can put at the bottom of your web page, like "powered by [MASK]".	0
Yeah.	0
Wow.	0
Anyway, quick question. How m-	0
You could put  wed  bugs in the email.	0
I see.	0
Yeah.	0
Like, there were  three  meetings this time, or so- or how many? Six?	0
Six.	0
But, no- of different people. So I guess if you're in  both  these types of meetings, you'd have a lot. But -	1
How - I mean, it  also  depends on how many -	1
Like, if we release - this time it's a fairly small number of meetings, but what if we release, like, twenty-five meetings to people?	1
Well, what my s- expectation is, is that we'll send out one of these emails  every time a meeting has been checked and is ready.	1
In th-	0
I don't know.	0
Oh. Oh, O_K. So this time was just the first chunk. O_K.	0
So. Tha- that was my intention. It's just - yeah - that we just  happened  to have a  bunch  all at once.	0
Well, that's a good idea.	0
I mean, maybe - Is that  the way it's gonna be, you think, Jane?	0
I agree with you.  It's - we could do it, uh - I- I could - I'd be happy with either way, batch-wise - What I was thinking - Uh, so  this  one -	0
That was exactly right, that we had a - uh, uh -	0
I - I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready.	0
Don't have it.	0
But, uh, this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable. People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
My, um - I was thinking that with the  N_S_A meetings, I'd like - there are three of  them,  and they're - uh, I - I will have  them  done by Monday.	0
Uh, unfortunately the time is later and I don't know how that's gonna work out, but I thought it'd be good to have  that  released as a clump, too, because then,	0
you know, they're - they - they have a - it- it's in a  category,  it's not quite so  distracting  to them, is what I was thinking, and it's all in one chu-	0
But after  that,  when we're caught up a bit on this process,  then,  um, I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available.	0
O_K.	0
I could do it either  way.  I mean, it's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking.	0
We heard anything from I_B_M?	1
at all ?	0
Uh. Let's see. We - Yeah, right. So we got the transcript back from that one meeting. Everything seemed fine.	1
Adam  had a script that will  put everything back together and there was - Well, there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix.	1
And then, um,  we, uh - I sent him a pointer to three more.	0
And so he's  off and  working on those.	0
Yeah. Now we haven't actually had anyone go  through  that meeting, to see whether the transcript is  correct  and to see how much was  missed  and all that sort of stuff. So at some point we need to do that.	1
Yeah.	0
That's on my list.	0
Well, that's on my list.	0
Yeah. It's gonna have to go through our regular	1
I mean, the  one  thing I noticed is it did miss a  lot  of backchannels. There are a fair number of "yeahs" and "uh-huhs" that - it's just - that aren't in there.	1
process.	1
So.	0
Hmm.	0
But I think - Yeah. Like you said, I mean, that's - that's gonna be our standard proc- that's what the transcribers are gonna be spending most of their time  doing,  I would imagine, once - once we -	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.	1
Yes, absolutely. Yeah.	0
It's gonna -	0
One question about the backchannels. Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre-segmenter?	1
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.	0
Oh, interesting.	0
Oh, interesting. O_K.	0
Yeah. They're - they're  not  in the segmented. It's not that the  I_B_M people didn't  do  it.	1
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
Just they didn't get marked.	0
O_K. So maybe when the detector for  that  gets better or something -   I w- I -	0
There's another issue which is this - we've been, uh, contacted by University of Washington now, of course, to, um -	1
We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those  six meetings	1
and they're downloading the	1
audio files. So they'll be doing that. Chuck's - Chuck's, uh,	1
put that in.	0
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I pointed them to the set that Andreas put, uh, on the	0
web so th- if they want to compare directly with  his  results they  can.	0
And, um, then once, uh,	0
th- we can also point them at the, um,	0
uh, the original meetings	0
and they can grab those, too, with [MASK]	0
Wait. So you put the  reference  files - ?	0
No, no. They d- they wanted the audio. Jane sent them the, uh, transcripts.	0
Or the - ?	0
No, I mean of the  transcripts.	0
Um.	0
Well, we can talk about it off-line.	0
There's another meeting in here, what, at  four?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right? Yeah, so we have to finish by three forty-five.	0
D- d- So, does Washi- does - does [MASK] wanna u- do this - wanna use this data for  recognition  or for something else?	0
Uh, for recognition.	0
I think they're doing w- didn't they want to do language modeling on, you know, recognition-compatible transcripts  or -  ?	0
Oh.	0
Oh.	0
I see.	0
Yeah.	0
This is to show you, uh, some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure.	0
Um  @@	0
So, this is from one of the N_S_A meetings and, uh, i- if you're familiar with the diff format, the arrow to the left is what it  was,  and the arrow to the right is  what it was  changed  to. So,	1
um.	0
And now the first one. "O_K. So, then we started a weekly meeting.	0
The last time, uh -" And the  transcriber  thought "little too much"	0
But,  uh,	0

really, um, it was "we  learned  too much", which makes more sense syntactically as well.	0

Uh, O_K. Um, next one. Um.	0
This was  an interesting one. So the original was "So that's not - so Claudia's not the  bad   master  here",   and then he laughs, but it really "web master".	0
Web master.	0
Oh.  Uh-oh.	0
And then you see another type of uncertainty which is, you know, they just didn't  know  what to make out of that.	0
Yep.	0
So instead of "split upon unknown",  it's "split in principle".	0
Jane, these are from I_B_M? The top lines?	0

Um. O_K, the next one,	0
uh,  this is a  term.  The problem with terminology. Description with th- the transcriber has "[MASK] as an advance".	0
But really it's "[MASK] in advance". I mean, I - I've benefited from some of these, uh, cross-group meetings.	0
O_K, then you got, um,	0
uh, instead of "from something-or-other cards",  it's "for multicast".	0
And instead of " [MASK]  system related", it's " end  system related". This was changed to an acronym initially and it should- shouldn't have been.	0
And then, you can see here "G_P_S" was misinterpreted.	0
It's just  totally  understanda- This is - this is a lot of  jargon.	0
Um, and the  final  one,	0
the transcriber had th- "in the core network   itself   or the  exit  unknown, not the  internet  unknown".	0
And it - it comes through as "in the core network itself of the  access  provider, not the internet  backbone   core ". Now this is a lot of  terminology.	0
Mmm.	0
And they're generally  extremely  good,	0
but, you know in this - this area it really does  pay  to, um - to double check and I'm hoping that when	1
the  checked  versions are run through the recognizer that you'll see s- substantial improvements in performance cuz the - you know, there're a lot of these in there.	1

Yeah.	0
It probably won't do any better.	0
But it's - I mean, it's definitely good that these are fixed. I mean,  obviously.	0
Well, also from the standpoint of getting people's approval, cuz if someone sees a page full of	0

Exactly. That's why we discussed that.	0
is that I was  afraid  people would say, "let's censor that because it's  wrong ", and I don't want them to do that.	0

And - and they  very  much appro- they mu- much prefer the new ones, and actually I -	1
I mean, I - I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the - the choice. We'd originally chosen, uh,	0

very   expensive  head- headsets but, um, they're just not as good as these, um,	0
Ugh!	0
in this - with this respect to this particular task.	0
Well, return the old ones.	0
It's probably impedance matching problems. But -	0
I don't know exactly, but we chose them because that's what's been used here by prominent projects in transcription. So it i- we had every reason to think they would work. Sorry, what?	0
Could be.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So you have spare headsets?	0
You have spare headsets?	1
They're  just earphones. They're not headsets. They're not microphones.	0
No, no. I mean, just earphones?	0
Right.	0
Um,	0
because I, uh,	1
I could use one on my workstation, just to t- because sometimes I have to listen to audio files and I don't have to b- go  borrow  it from	1
someone and -	0
We have actua- actually I have - W- Well, the thing is, that if we have four people come to work  for a day, I was - I was hanging on to the others	0
Oh, O_K.	0
for, eh - for spares, but I can tell you what I recommend.	0
No, but you'd - If you - Yeah, w- we should  get  it.	0
Sure. No problem. I just -	0
But if you need it, just  get  it. Come  on.	0
Right.	0
Yeah. If you  need  it. Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
They're - they're - they're - they're pretty inexpensive. Yeah.	0
Yeah, I still - I still need to get a pair, too.	1
It'd just have to be a s- a separate order - an added order.	0
Yeah, that -	0
We should order a cou- uh, t-	0
I'm using one of these. Yeah.	0
two or three or four, actually. We have -	0
I think I have a pair that I brought from home, but it's f- just for music listening and it's not - Nnn. Yeah.	0
No. Just - just - just - just buy them.	1
Sh- Just get the model number and - Where do you buy these from? Like - ?	0
Just buy them.	0
Yeah.	0
[MASK] just down the street.	0
You just b- go and b-  Oh.	0
Yeah. They always have them in stock.	0
Yeah.	0
Anyway.	0
That'd be a good idea.	0
W- uh, could you email out the brand?	0
Yeah.	0
Oh, sure. Yeah. O_K.	0
Cuz I think - sounds like people are interested. So.	0
Yeah.	0
Definitely.	0
Yeah.	0
It's made a difference in - in how easy. Yeah.	0
I realized something I should talk about. So what's the other thing on the agenda  actually ?	0
Uh, the only one was Don wanted to, uh, talk about	1
disk space yet again.	1
Yeah.	0
u- It's short. I mean, if you wanna go, we can just throw it in at the end.	0
No, no. Why don't you - why don't you go ahead since it's short.	0
Um, well, uh.	0
Oh, I thought you meant the disk space. Yeah, we  know  disk space is short.	0
The disk space was short. Yeah. That's what I thought too.	1
That's a  great  ambiguity.	0
Yeah.	0
It's one of these - it's - it's  social  and, uh, discourse level and -	0
It's -	0
Yeah.	0
I- i- i- it- i-	0
Yeah, it's  great.  Yeah, double - double -	0
Sorry.  See, if I had that little  scratch-pad, I would have made an [MASK] there.	0
Yeah, it was really goo-	0
Thank you, thank you.	0
Uh, well, we'll  give  you one then.	0
Yeah.	0
Um.	0
So, um, without thinking about it, when I offered up my  hard  drive last week -	0
Oh, no.	0
It was while I was out of town.	0
Um, this is always a suspect phrase.	0
But, um,  no.  I, uh - I realized that we're going to be doing a lot of experiments, um,	0
o- for this, uh, paper we're writing, so we're probably gonna need a lot more - We're probably gonna need	0
that  disk space that we  had  on that eighteen gig hard drive. But,	0
um, we also have someone else coming in that's gonna help us out with some stuff. So -	0
We've just ordered a hundred gigabytes.	1
I think we need, like, another eighteen gig disk  to be safe.	0
O_K. We just need to -	0
Well, we're getting three thirty - thirty-sixes.	0
So.	0
O_K.	0
Right? That are going into the main f- file server. So.	0
O_K.	0
Markham's ordering and they should be coming in soon.	0
W- Well. So - so -	0
Soon?	0
Yeah. I mean, I guess the thing is is, all I need is to hang it off, like,	1
the person who's coming in, Sonali's, computer.	1
Oh, so - so, you mean the d- the internal - the disks on the machines that we just got?	0
Whew.	0
Or we can  move   them.	0
No.	0
Or  extra  disk?	0
These are gonna go onto Abbott.	0
Ne- new disks.	0
Onto Abbott, the file server.	0
So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in? O_K. That's fine.	0
Oh, oh. O_K.	0
On - Yeah.	0
Once they come in. Sure.	0
Uh, i-	0
Do - when - when is this planned for  roughly?	0
They should be - I - I imagine next week or something.	0
O_K. So -	0
If you're - if you're  desperate,  I have some space on my drive.	1
O_K.	0
I think if I'm -	0
But I - I vacillate between no space free and  a few gig free. So.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah. I think I can find something if I'm desperate and, um, in the meantime I'll just hold out. That was the only thing I wanted to bring up.	1
O_K.	0
It should be  soon.  We - we should -	0
O_K.	0
So there's another hundred gig. So.	0
Alright. Great.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
It's  great  to be able to  do  it, just say "oh yeah, a hundred gig, no big deal".	0
That's it.	0
Good.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.  A hundred gig here, a hundred gig there.  It's eventually	0
Well, each  meeting  is like a  gig  or something, so it's really -	0
Yeah.	0
real disk space.	0
Yeah.	0
Um. Yeah. I was just going to comment that I- I'm going to, uh, be on the phone with Mari tomorrow, late afternoon. We're supposed to	0
Oh, yeah.	0
get together and talk about, uh, where we are on things. Uh, there's this meeting coming  up,	0
uh, and there's  also  an annual report. Now, I never actually - I - I was  asking  about this. I don't really  quite  understand this.	1
She was re- she was referring to it as - I think this actually  didn't just come from her, but this is  what, uh, DARPA had asked for.	0
Um, she's referring to it as the an- annual report for the fiscal  year.  But of course the fiscal year starts in  October,	0
so I don't quite understand w- w-	0
why we do an annual report that	0
She's either really late or really early.	0
we're writing in July.	0
Huh.	0
Or she's getting a good early start.	0
Uh, I think basically it- it's none of those. It's that the meeting is in July so they - so [MASK] just said do an annual report. So.	1
So.	0
So anyway, I'll be putting together stuff. I'll do it,	1
uh, you know, as much as I can without bothering people, just by looking at - at papers and status reports. I mean, the status reports you do are very helpful.	1
Hmm.	0
Uh, so I can grab stuff there. And if, uh - if I have some questions I'll -	1
When we remember to fill  them   out.	1
Yeah.  If   people could do it as soon as - as you can, if you haven't done one si- recently. Uh.	0
Uh, but, you know, I'm - I'm sure before  it's all done, I'll end up bugging people for - for more clarification about stuff.	1
Um.	0
But, um, I don't know, I guess - I guess I know	0
pretty  much  what people have been doing.  We have these meetings and - and there's the status reports.	0
Uh.	0
But, um.	0
Um.	0
Yeah. So that wasn't a long one. Just to  tell  you that. And if something	0
hasn't,  uh - I'll be talking to her late	0
tomorrow afternoon, and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it's important thing to mention on	0
this kind of thing, uh, uh, just pop me a one-liner and - and - and I'll - I'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation.	0
O_K.	0
Uh.	0
I guess, uh, you- you're still	0
pecking away at the  demos and all that, probably.	0
Yep.	0
And Don is  gonna be helping out with that. So.	0
Oh, that's right.	0
O_K.	0
Did you wanna talk about that this afternoon?	0
Um.	0
Not here, but later today?	0
We should probably talk off-line about when we're gonna talk off-line.	0
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
O_K. Yeah, I might want to get updated about it in about a week cuz, um, I'm actually gonna have a -	0
a few days off the following week,	0
a- after the - after the picnic. So.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
That's all I had.	0
So we were gonna do sort of	0
status of speech transcription - automatic transcription, but we're kind of running late. So.	0
How long does it take you to save the data?	0
Fifteen minutes. So.	0
Yeah.	0
If you wanna do a quick	0
Yeah.	0
ten minute -	0
Guess we should stop, like, twenty of at the latest. We - we have another meeting coming in that they wanna record. So.	0
Uh -	0
And  there's the digits to do. So maybe - may- maybe - maybe -  We  could.	0
Yeah. Well, we can skip the digits.	0
Fi- five minute report or something.	0
It's up to  you.  I don't -	0
Yeah, yeah. Well, I would love to hear about it, especially since -	0
Whatever you want.	0
What do you have to say? I'm interested, so -	0
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna be on the phone tomorrow, so this is just a  good example of  the sort of thing I'd like to  hear about.	0
Wait. Why is everybody looking at  me?	0
Sorry.	0
I don't know.	0
Cuz  he  looked at you and says you're sketching.	0
What?	0
Uh. I'm not sure what you were referring to.	0
Who's - ?	0
I - I - I - I'm not - actually, I'm not sure what - ?	0
Are we supposed to have  done  something?	0
No. We were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting.	0
Oh.	0
Alternating.	0
Uh-huh.	0
And this week we were gonna  try  to do  t- automatic transcription  status.	0
I wasn't here last week. Sorry.	0
Oh!	0
Oh.	0
We did that  last  week. Right?	0
But we sort of failed.	0
Hhh.	0
No.	0
I  thought  we did.	0
Did we? O_K.	0
Yeah. We did.	0
O_K. So now -  now  we have the schedule. So  next  week we'll do automatic transcription status, plus anything that's real timely.	1

the new data that Don will start to process - the, um -	1

And so that's sort of a	1
stage-two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step.	1
Right.	0
I'll be interested.	0
We did get our, um - I guess,  good  news. We got our abstract accepted for this conference, um -  workshop,  ISCA workshop, in, um,	1
uh, New Jersey.	1

The t- paper isn't due until August. The abstracts were already due. So it's that kind of workshop.	0

sort of the European experts in prosody - sort of a different crowd, and I think we're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far, so that should be interesting.	1
