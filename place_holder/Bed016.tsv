which is probably  not,  uh, the case	0
in that discotheque example, or in the Bavaria example, you just want to know where it  is.	0

one that might ask for  directions  instead of just  location.	1

Yeah, if somebody has something to say.	0
Yep.	0
You might want to, uh, double-check the spellings of the authors' names on your references, you had a few, uh,	1
misspells in your slides, there. Like I believe you had "Jackendorf".	1
Um.	0
Uh, unless there's a person called "Jackendorf", yeah.	0
No, no, no.	0
On  that  one?	0
But that's the only thing I noticed in there.	0
In the presentation?	0

I'll probably - I c- might have - I'll probably have comments for you separately, not  important .  Anyway.	0
Oh, in the  presentation  here. I was ac- actually worried about  bibtex.  Uh. No,  that's  quite possible.	0
Yeah, that's what he was talking about.	0
Yeah.	0
That's copy and paste from	0
something.	0
So I did note- i- i- it looks like the, uh,  metaphor  didn't get in yet.	1
Uh, it  did,  there is a reference to Srini -	0
Well, s- reference is  one  thing, the question is is there any place - Oh, did you put in something about,	0
Metonymy and metaphor here, right?	0
uh, the individual,	0
we'd talked about putting in something	0
about people had,	0
uh - Oh yeah, O_K.	0
Good.  I  see where you have it.	0
So the top of the second - of pa- page two you have a sentence.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
But,	0
what I  meant  is,	0
I think  even   before  you  give  this,	0
to Wahlster,	0
uh, you should,	0
unless  you put it in the text, and I don't think it's there yet,  about - we  talked  about is the, um,  scalability  that you get by, um,	0
combining the constructions with the general  construal  mechanism. Is that in there?	0
Yeah, mmm. Um.	0
Uh, O_K, so where - where is it, cuz I'll have to take a look.	0
Um, but I - I did not focus on  that  aspect but, um -	0
Ehhh,	0
um, it's just underneath, uh,	0
um,	0
that reference to metaphor. So it's the last paragraph	0
before two. So on page two,	0
um, the main focus -	0
Uh, O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
But that's really -	0
That's not about that,  @@  is it?	0
Yeah.	0
No, it - it -	1
it s-  says  it but it doesn't say - it doesn't - it d- it d- yeah, it doesn't give the punch line.	1
Why.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line  is,  because it's actually important,	0
which is, that,	1
the	1
constructions,  that, uh, Nancy and Keith and friends are doing,	1
uh, are,	1
in a  way,  quite  general	1
but	1
cover only base cases. And	1
to make them apply	1
to  metaphorical  cases and  metonymic  cases and all those things, requires this additional mechanism,	1
of  construal.  And the punch line is, he claimed,	1
that	1
if you do this  right,  you can get	1
essentially orthogonality, that	1
if you introduce a new construction	1
at - at the base level, it should com- uh, interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And, similarly, if you introduce a new metaphor,	1
Mm-hmm.	0
it should then	1
uh, compose with all of the constructions.	1
Yeah.	0
And it - to the extent that that's  true  then - then	0
it's a  big  win over anything that  exists.	0
So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your	0
context-free grammar	0
you just have	0
these  base  constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them.	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So that, you know, for example,	0
uh, in the metaphor case, that you have a kind of direct	0
idea of a source, path, and goal	0
and any metaphorical one - and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff  - you	0
can  do  the same  grammar.	0
And it  is  the same grammar.	0
Mmm.	0
But,	0
um, the trick is that the -	0
the way the  construction's  written	0
it requires that the object of the  preposition   for example be a container.	0
Well, "trouble" isn't a container, but it gets constr-  construed  as a c- container.	0
Right.	0
Et cetera. So that's -	0
that's where this, um,	0
So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule.	0
Right.	0
So's it's - it -	0
it's a very big deal, i- i- in this framework, and the	0
thesis proposal as it stands doesn't,	0
um,  I  don't think, say that as clearly as it  could.	0
No, it doesn't say it at  all.  No.	0
Even though -	0
One could argue what - if there  are  basic cases, even.	0
I mean, it seems like  nothing  is context- free.	1
Oh,  nothing  is context- free,	1
but there  are  basic  cases.  That is,	1
um, there are physical containers, there are physical paths, there - you know, et cetera.	1
But "walked into the cafe and ordered a drink," and "walked into the cafe and broke his nose," that's sort of -	1
Oh, it doesn't mean that they're  unambiguous.  I mean, a cafe  can  be construed as a container, or it  can  be construed	1
Mmm. Yeah.	0
Uh-huh.	0
you know as - as a obstacle, or as some physical object. So there are  multiple   construals.	0
And in fact that's  part  of what has to be  done.  This is why there's this interaction between the analysis	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and the construal.	0
Yep .	0
The b- the - the double arrow.	0
Yep.	0
So, uh,  yeah,  I mean, it doesn't  magically  make	0
ambiguity  go away.	0
No .	0
But it  does  say that,	1
uh, if	1
you walked into the  cafe  and broke your nose, then you  are  construing the cafe	1
Mm-hmm.	0
as an  obstacle.	1
And if that's  not  consistent with	0
other  things,  then	0
you've gotta reject that reading.	0
Yep.	0
You con - you conditioned me with your first sentence, and so I thought, "Why would he walk  into  the  cafe  and then	0
somehow break his nose?" uh,	0
He slipped on the wet floor.	0
oh, uh -	0
Right.	0
You don't find that usage, uh - uh, I checked for it in the Brown national corpus. The "walk into it" never really means, w- as in walked smack -	1
Yeah.	0
But "run into" does.	1
Yeah, but, y- y- if you find "walked  smacked  into the cafe" or " slammed  into the wall" -	0
Yeah, no,	0
but " run  into"  does.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Because you will find "run into,"	0
uh,	0
Cars run into telephone poles all the time.	0
well, or "into the  cafe " for that m- you know - "His car ran into the cafe."	0
Right.	0
Yeah. Or you can run into an old friend, or run.	0
Well, you can "run into" in  that  sense too.	0
No!	0
But, uh,	0
Yeah, "run into" might even be more impact sense than,	0
you know,	0
container sense.	0
Right.	0
Depends.	0
But - Like, "run into an old friend",	1

anything else you want to  ask  us about	1

the thesis proposal, you got -	1

Well there - actually -	0
the - i- what would have been  really  nice is to find an example for	1
all  of this,	1
uh,	1
from our domain.	1
So maybe if we w- if we can make one  up    now,  that would be c- incredibly helpful.	0
So, w- where it should illustrate	0
O_K.	0
How -	0
uh - wh- when you say  all  this, do you mean, like, I don't know, the related work stuff, as well as,	0
Right - right - r-	0
mappings?	0
w- Well we have, for example, a canonical use of something and y- it's, you know, we have some constructions and then it's construed as something, and then we - we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use	1
that's also relevant to the - to the domain.	1
O_K, f- let's - let's suppose you use "in" and "on".	0
I mean, that's what you  started  with.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So "in the bus" and "on the bus," um, that's actually a  little  tricky in English because to  some  extent they're  synonyms.	1
O_K.	0
I had two hours w- with George on this, so it, um -	0
O_K, what did he say.	0
Did you?  Join the club.	0
Right. Oh, h- that's -	0
Um.	0
"On the bus" is a m- is a metaphorical metonymy	0
that relates some meta- path metaphorically and you're on - on that path and	0
th- w- I mean it's - he - there's a  platform  notion, right? "he's on the - standing on the bus waving to me." But th- the  regular  as we speak "J- Johno was on the bus to New York," um, uh, he's -	0
Yeah, I - I believe all that, it's just -	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
that's, uh, what did I call it here, the transportation schema, something, where you can be on the first flight, on the second flight, and you can be, you know,	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Right. So - so that - that may or may not be what you - what you want to do. I mean you  could  do something much simpler	1
on the wagon.	0
Yeah.	0
like " under  the bus," or something, where -	0
But it's - it's -  unfortunately,  this is not really something a  tourist  would ever  say.	0
So.	0
Well,  unless he was  repairing  it or something, but  yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
But um.	0
Uh, but O_K.	0
So in terms of the - this - We had - we had -  initially  we'd - started discussing the "out of film."	1
I see.	0
Right.	0
And there's a lot of "out of" analysis, so, um,	0
Right.	0
could we capture  that  with a different construal of -	0
Yeah, it's a little - it's, uh - we've thought about it before, uh t- uh - to use the examples in other papers, and it's - it's a little complicated.	1
Out of - out of film, in particular.	0
Cuz you're like, it's a state of - there's resource, right, and like,	0
Yeah.	0
what is film, the state - you know. You're out of the state of having film, right? and somehow film is standing for the re- the resour- the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource.	0
It's - yeah, I mean, but - and plus the fact that there's also s- I mean, can you say, like,	0
I mean.	0
It's a little bit -	0
"The film ran out" you know, or, maybe you could say something like "The film is out" so like the - the film went away from where it  should  be, namely with  you,  or something, right? You know.	0
Yeah, is film the trajector?	0
The - the film - the film is gone, right? Um,	0
I never really knew what was going on, I mean I - I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that - that "I'm out of film" means that I have left the state of having film or something like that, but.	0
It's weird.	0
That -	0
Uh.	0
Or, "having" is also, um, associated with location, right? so if the film  left , you know - state is being near film.	0
Yeah. Yeah.	0
So running - running out of something is different from being out of somewhere.	0
Or being out of  something  as, uh - as  well.	0
So "running out of it" definitely has a  process  aspect to it.	0
Mm-hmm. But that's from run, yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So,	0
b- that's O_K, I mean - b- but the difference	0
Yeah.	0
Is the d- the final  state  of running out of something is being  out  of it.	0
is -	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Yeah. So th-	0
You  got  there.  You got to  out  of it. Yeah.	0
That  part is fine.	0
Yeah.	0
But, uh -	0
Hmm!	0
Yeah,  so - so nob- so no one has in - in - of the,	0
uh,	0
professional linguists, they haven't - there was this whole  thesis  on "out of".	0
Uh.	0
There  was?  Who?	0
Well, there - I  thought  - or there was a paper on it. Huh?	0
Out.	0
There was one on - on "out" or "out of"?	0
There was a-	0
Well, it may be just "out". Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
I think there was "over" but there was also a paper on "out".	0
Yeah, Lind- Susan Lindner, right? The - the - "the syrup spread out"? That kind of thing?	0
Or something.	0
Oh, yeah, you're right. Yeah.	0
Yeah, and all that sort of stuff.	0
Yeah.	0
And undoubtably there's been  reams  of work about it in cognitive linguistics, but.	0
O_K. But anyway. We're not gonna do that between now and next week.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
So,	0
um -	0
It's not one of the y- it's more straightforward ones - forward ones to defend, so you probably don't want to use it for the purposes - th- these are - you're addressing like, computational linguists, right. Or - are you?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right.	0
O_K.	0
There's gonna be four	0
computational linguists,	0
O_K. But more	0
computer-	0
emphasis on the computational? Or emphasis on the linguist?	0
it's  -	0
More - there's going to be the - just four computational linguists, by coincidence, but the rest is, whatever, biocomputing people and physicists.	0
No no no, but not for your  talk.  I'm- we're worrying about the th- the thes- it's just for one guy.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
Oh, the  thesis!  That's - that's computa- should be very computational, and, uh, someth-	0
Oh, I meant  this,  you know, like -	0
O_K. So I would try to - I would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff.	1
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
You know, it's an obvious one -  but, uh  -	0
Totally weird stuff.	0
I mean the - the old  bakery  example might be nice, "Is there a  bakery  around here". So if you c- we really just construe it as a -	1
Yeah.	0
Around?	0
No, it's the bakery  itself  - is it a building? uh, that you want to go to? or is it something to  eat  that you want to  buy?	0
Oh.	0
Oh, oh yeah. Yeah, we've thought about that. Right. Right.	0
And then -	0
Nnn.	0
No.   What?  " Bakery " can't be something you're gonna eat.	0
No, no. The question is d- do you wanna - do you wanna construe - do you wanna constr-strue	0
Sh-	0
It's a speech-act.	0
r- Exactly. It's because do you wanna c- do you want to view	0
Yeah.	0
the bakery as a p- a place that - that - i- for example, if - y-	0
Where you can get baked goods.	0
Well th- well, that's  one.  You want to  buy  something.	0
But the  other  is,	0
uh, yo- you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there'd be a bakery in the neighborhood, or,	0
Mm-hmm.	0
um, pfff	0
you know, you wonder how people here make their living, and - there're all sorts of reasons why you might	1
Yeah.	0
be asking about the existence of a bakery that  doesn't  mean, "I want to buy some  baked  goods."	1
O_K.	0
But	0
um, those are interesting examples but it's not clear that they're  mainly	1
construal  examples.	1
Yeah.	0
So it's a lot of pragmatics, there, that	0
Mmm.	0
There's all sorts of stuff going on. So	0
might be beyond what you want to do.	0
let's - so let's think about this from the point of view	0
of construal. So let's first do	0
a - So the  metonymy  thing	1
is	0
probably the  easiest  and a- and actually the -	1
Though, the one you  have  isn't quite -	0
You mean the s-	0
You mean "the steak wants to pay"?	0
N- no not  that  one, that's - that's a - the sort of	0
background.  This is the t- uh, page five.	0
About Plato and the book?	0
No.	0
Oh. Um.	0
No.	0
Onward.	0
Just beyond that.	0
How much does  it  cost?	0
Where is the castle? How old is it? How much does it cost?	1
Yeah.	0
A castle.	0
Oh.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
To go in, that's like -	0
Two hundred  million  dollars.	0
Right.	0
It's not for sale.	0
Uh.	0
So	0
Yeah, I think that's a good example, actually.	0
S-	0
Yeah, that's good. u-	0
But as Nancy just su- suggested it's probably   ellipticus.   Huh.	1
Ellipsis.	0
Like, " it " doesn't refer to "thing," it refers to acti- you know, j- thing standing for activ- most relevant activity for a tourist - you could think of it that way, but.	0
Yeah.	0
Well, shoot, isn't that - I mean, that's what -	0
Well,  I mean, my argument  here  is - it's - it's - it's the same thing as "Plato's on the top shelf," I'm con- you know, th- that you can refer to	1
figuring that out is what this is about.	0
Yeah, yeah, no, I- I agree.	0
a book of Plato by using "Plato," and you can	0
Yeah.	0
No no, I - I'm agreeing that this is a good, um -	0
refer back to it, and so you can - Castles have - as tourist sites, have admission fees, so you can say "Where is the castle, how much does it cost?"	0
Um.	0
"How far is it	0
Mm-hmm.	0
from here?" So,	0
You're also not	0
referring to the	0
Hmm.	0
width of the object, or so, www.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Mmm.	0
O_K. Can we think of a nice	1
metaphorical  use of "where"	1
in the tourist's domain?	1
Um.	0
Hmm.	0
So you know it's -	0
you - you can  sometimes  use " where " f- for " when "	0
O-	0
in the sense of, you know,	0
um,	0
where - wh- where - where was, um,	0
"where was Heidelberg, um, in the Thirty Years' War?"	1
Or something.	0
Uh, yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
You know, or some such thing.	0
Like what side were they on, or - ?	0
Um.	0
What?	0
Yeah. Essentially, yeah.	0
O_K. I was like, "Huh? It was  here. " Like -  Um.	0
But anyway th- so there are - there are cases like that. Um,	0
Ah!	0
Or like its developmental state or something like that, you could - I guess you could get that.	0
Yeah.	0
Um.	0
Um.	0
I mean, there's also things like - I mean, s- um, I guess	0
I could ask something like "Where can I find out about blah-blah-blah" in a sort of -	0
doesn't nece- I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location, just give me a phone number and I'll call them or something like that?	0
Yeah. There certainly is that, yeah.	0
You know, "Where could I learn its opening hours," or something.	1
Yeah.	0
But that's	1
Hmm.	0
not  metaphorical.	1
It's another -	0
Yeah.	0
So we're thinking about, um,	0
or we could also think about,	0
uh -	0
Well, I - I - I -	0
How about "I'm in a hurry"?	0
State.	0
It i- But it's a state - and the - the issue is,	0
Hmm?	0
is that - it  may  be just a  usage,	0
you know, that it's not particularly metaphorical, I don't know.	0
Mmm.	0
Right.	0
Oh.	0
So you want a more exotic one - version of that.	0
Yeah. Yeah, right.	0
I'm really into -	0
Ah! How about	0
I - I - I - you know, "I'm in - I'm in a state of exhaustion"?	0
or something like that, which a tourist w- Huh?	0
Do you really say that?	0
Would you really say that?	0
A st- uh, well, you can certainly say, um, you know, "I'm in overload."	1
Yeah.	0
I- I'm really into art. Uh -	0
Tu- stur- tourists will often say that.	0
Yeah, I was gonna say, like -	0
Oh, you can do  that?	0
Really? Of course that's - that - that's definitely a, uh -	0
Fixed.	0
A fixed expression, yeah.	1
that's a, uh -	0
Right. But. -	0
There're too - there're all sorts of fixed expressions I don't -  like uh	0
"I'm out of sorts now!"	0
Right.	0
Like	0
"I'm in trouble!"	0
Well I - when, uh - just f- u- the data that I've looked at so far that rec- I mean, there's tons of cases for polysemy.	1
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
So, you know, mak- re- making reference to buildings as institutions, as containers, as build- you know, whatever.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Right.	0
Um, so ib- in mus- for example, in museums, you know, as a building or as something where pictures  hang  versus, you know,	0
ev- something that puts on exhibits, so forth. But -	0
Right. As an institution, yeah.	0
Um.	0
Why don't you want to use any of those?	0
Hmm?	0
So y- you don't wanna use one that's -	0
Yeah, well - No, but this - that's what I have, you know, started doing.	0
The castle - the - that old castle one is sort of -	0
Metonymy, polysemy.	0
I love Van Gogh.	0
Yeah.	0
Ah!	0
"I wanna go see the Van Gogh."	0
Oh geez.	0
Anyway, I'm sorry.	0
But I think the argument should be -	1
uh, can be made that,	1
you know, despite the fact that this is  not  the most met- metaphorical domain, because people interacting with  H_T_I  systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical,	1
Yeah.	0
construal  still  is, uh, you know, completely,	0
um, key in terms of finding out  any  of these things, so,	0
Right.	0
um.	0
So that's - that's - that's a - that's a reasonable point, that it - in  this  domain you're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy.	0
We, uh - I - with a - I looked - with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy.	0
And polysemy, and stuff like that.	0
Yeah.	0
Hardly anything. So not even in  descriptions	0
w- did we find anything, um,	0
relevant.	0
I have to go.	0
Alright. Yeah.	0
But O_K this is just something we'll - we'll see, um,	0
Right.	0
s- See you.	0
and deal with.	0
O_K, well.	0
I guess if anybody has additional suggestions, w- Yeah.	0
I mean maybe the "where is something" question as a  whole,  you know, can be construed as, u- i- locational versus instructional request.	1
So, if we're not talk about the lexic-	0
Location versus what?	0
instruction.	0
Instruction. Oh, directions? Yeah. Oh, I thought that was -	0
Sure.	0
Yeah.	0
definitely treated as an example of construal.	0
Right?  @@	0
Yeah but then you're not on the lexical level, that's sort of one level higher.	1
Oh, you want a lexical example.	0
But I don't need it.	0
Well, you  might  want  both.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Also it  would  be nice to get - ultimately to get a nice mental  space  example, so, even  temporal  references are -	1
We -	0
just in the  spatial  domain are rare.	1
But it's - it's  easy  to make up  plausible  ones.	0
You know.	0
When - when you're getting  information  on objects. So, I mean -	0
Right, you know - you know, where r- Yeah.	0
What color was this in - in	0
in the nain- nineteenth century. What was this p- instead of - wh- what - you know - how was this painted, what color was this painted, um,	0
Yeah.	0
was this alleyway open.	0
Yeah, maybe we can include that also in our second, uh, data run. We c- we can show people pictures of objects and then	1
Uh.	0
have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K. So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically.	1
Wish you a good trip.	0
All success.	0
For some reason when you said "feedback electronically" I thought of that - you ever see the Simpsons where they're - like the family's got the buzzers	0
and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying?	0
Yeah. That's the -	0
first  one, I think. The very very first one.	0
It was a very early one. I don't know if it's the first one.	0
Mmm.	0
Mmm.	0
