Alright, so I'm- I should read all of these numbers?	0
O_K.	0
Piece of paper? I could borrow?	0
Oh yeah.	0
O_K, so uh i- um	0
I don't know whether Ami's coming or not um	0
Nancy	0
but I think we oughta just get started.	0
is uh-	0
Nancy's still stick?	0
currently in Berkeley	0
but not here?	0
Don't know.	0
O_K.	0
Anyway	0
Oh, so there you go.	0
Anyway, so my idea f- for today and we can uh	0
decide that that isn't the right thing to do	0
was to at - spend at least part of the time	0
trying to	0
eh build the influence links, you know	0
which sets of things are	0
uh relevant	0
to which decisions	0
and actually I had	0
uh specific s-  suggestion   to start first with the path ones.	0
The database ones being	0
in some sense less interesting to us although probably have to be done	0
and so to do that	0
so there's - and the idea was we were gonna do two things	0
Is your mike on?	0
Oops.	0
Ah.	0
Oh right, well.	0
That's funny.	0
Yeah. We were gonna do two things	1
one of which is	1
just lay out the	1
influence structure of what we think influences what	1
and then as a uh separate but related task	0
uh particularly Bhaskara and I were going to	0
try to decide	0
what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to	0
um	0
do what we - what we need to do. Once	0
so but du- we should sort of have all of the uh	1
basic design of what influences what	1
done before we decide exactly how to compute it.	1
So I didn't - did you get a chance to look at all - yet?	0
Yeah, I looked at some of that stuff.	0
Great. O_K so let's	0
start with the	0
uh belief-nets, the general influence stuff and then we'll - then we'll also	0
at some point break and talk about the techy stuff.	0
Well I think one could go	0
there's	0
I think we can di- discuss everything.	0
First of all this I added, I	0
knew from	0
sort of basically this has to be there right? Um	0
Oh are you gonna go there or not? Yeah, so one i-	0
Given - given uh uh not transverse the castle, the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just	0
Right, true. Does have to be there.	0
And	0
And I'm sure we'll find more as we go that	0
Hmm?	0
So Go-there in the first place or not is definitely	1
uh one of the basic ones. We can start	1
with that.	0
Interesting effect.	0
Um	0
Is this	0
basically true or false	0
or maybe	0
we'll get	0
Well -	0
Which one?	0
what?	0
"Go there".	0
m- right. Here we	0
so	0
there is this question about	0
we actually get just probabilities, right for each down here.	0
Yeah.	0
When we're - yeah when we're done.	0
Hmm.	0
So - so  @@	0
the - the reason it might not be true or false	0
is that we did have this idea of when	0
so it's, you know	0
uh current  @@  and so forth and so on or not at all, right?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And so that a decision would be	0
do we want	0
that	0
so you could - two different things you could do, you could have	1
all those values for Go-there or you could have Go-there be binary and given that you're going there	1
When.	0
when.	1
How.	0
Yeah and so  forth .	0
Why, yeah.	0
So I'll let	0
we'll see.	0
Hmm?	0
I mean it seems that you could	0
um	0
uh it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would wanna have them	0
separate or binary, Go-there and then the - the possibilities of how to go there because -	0
O_K, that's - let's start that way.	0
because, you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but	0
it's much more complex to query	0
Hmm.	0
when would be the most appropriate time.	0
Hmm.	0
O_K.	0
And so I've tried to come up with some initial	0
things one could observe so who is the user?	0
Everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model-A_.	1
We should be	0
be clear.	0
But when it comes to sort of writing down when you - when you do these things is it here?	0
You sort of	0
have to a- write the values this can take.	0
Right.	0
And here I was really	0
uh in some	0
s- sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because	0
um - this case it's pretty simple, but as we will see the other ones	0
um	0
for example if it's a running budget	0
so what are the discrete values of a running budget?	0
So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished.	0
Hmm.	0
No uh	0
How can I write here that this is something, a number that cr- keeps on changing?	0
But O_K.	0
Thus is understandable?	0
Yes.	0
Think so.	0
So here for example.	0
You've s- have you seen this before at all Keith, these belief-net things?	0
Uh, no, but I think I'm following it.	0
So here is the - the - we had that the user's budget may influence	1
So far.	0
the outcome of decisions.	1
Yeah.	0
Hmm.	0
There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of	0
things.	0
Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend?	0
O_K, h- well I mean how is it different from user finance?	0
Um the finance is sort of here thought of as - as the financial policy a person	1
carries out in his life, he - is he cheap, average, or spendy?	1
Alright.	0
And um I didn't come uh maybe a user	0
I don't know, I didn't want to write greediness, but	0
Yeah.	0
Hmm.	0
Welcome.	0
Or cheapness.	0
Welcome.	0
User thrift.	0
Yeah.	0
Thrift, that's good.	0
Great.	0
There it is.	0
Yeah. So Keith	0
w- what's behind this is actually a program that will	0
once you fill all this in actually s- solve your belief-nets for you and stuff. So this is not just a display, this is actually a GUI to	1
Mm-hmm.	0
a simulator that will	1
if we tell it all the right things we'll	1
O_K.	0
wind up with a functioning belief-net at the other end.	1
O_K.	0
And it's so simple even I can use it.	0
Wow, that is simple.	0
O_K, so here was O_K, I can think of uh	0
people being cheap, average, or spendy or we can even have a - a finer scale moderately cheap, doesn't matter.	0
Doesn't matter.	0
Agree there	0
but here	0
um	0
I wasn't sure what to write in.	0
Let's -	0
go ahead.	0
Well, I mean	0
you've written in - you've written in what uh seems to be required like what else is - is	0
do you want?	0
If that's permissible then I'm happy.	0
Well yeah. So here's - here's what's permissible	0
is that	0
you can arrange	0
so that the um	0
the value of that	0
is gonna have to be updated and n- it's not a belief update, right? It's - you took some actions, you spent money and stuff, so the update of that	1
is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief-net.	0
Yeah.	0
Right?	0
And then what you're going to need	0
is uh for	0
the things that it influences. Well let's - first of all let's see if it does influence anything.	0
And if it does influence anything	1
then you're gonna need something that converts from	1
the - the number here to something that's relevant to the decision there.	1
So it could be ra- they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or	0
whatever - but for the moment this is just	0
a node that is conditioned externally	0
and might influence	0
various things.	0
Hmm.	0
Yeah - this is where	0
um O_K anyways	0
let's	0
forget it.	0
Well that's fine.	0
Well anyway, go ahead.	0
O_K, and so	0
this, oh	0
that	0
The other thing is that um every time that's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is	1
do you - do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it's updated or only when we need to?	1
Yeah, that's a good question.	0
And uh	0
does it have a lazy mode?	0
I don't remember.	0
Uh	0
Well, I mean, in Srini's thing there was this thing - there was this um	0
Oh right.	0
option like  proper  inferences which suggests that uh	0
Yeah.	0
S- probably does.	0
doesn't happen, automatically.	0
Yeah	0
someone has to track that down, but I - but uh	0
I just accidentally	0
And - and - and I think - actually uh	0
Oops.	0
one of the we- w- items for the uh	0
user	0
home base	0
uh should be uh	0
essentially non-local.	0
I- they're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they're staying.	0
Well	0
Oh just uh accidentally erased this, I - I just had values here such as uh	0
um is he s- we had	0
in our list we had "Is he staying in our hotel?", "Is he staying with friends?", and so forth  uh	0
Yeah.	0
so we're	0
O_K.	0
So	0
it's clear where w- w- w- where we are right now.	0
So my suggestion is we just pick	0
uh	0
Something down here?	0
one, you know one uh particular one of the uh	0
well let's do the first - first one let's do the one	0
that we	0
sort of already think we did so w- that was the - of the endpoint?	1
Mm-hmm.	0
And um	0
Oops.	0
Is	0
hmm	0
Ah, O_K.	0
So it's true or false?	0
No no no, E_V_A.	0
No, that's - that's a  @@	0
Missed that one.	0
So	0
What's the difference between mode	0
I thought mode, yeah.	0
and endpoint?	0
Um mode was um	0
although that	0
Well, that's  @@	0
Mode of transportation?	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
Also true or false.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
No, he has- he hasn't filled them in yet, is what's true.	0
Yeah, O_K.	0
Did I or didn't I?	0
Ah.	0
Probably nothing done yet, oh I just did it on the upper ones, O_K.	0
Makes sense.	0
O_K, so this was E_V_A.	1
Maybe we can think of more things, cross	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
Climb, rob.	0
climb, emerge	0
No no no, these are ju- that's just a point, this is ju-	0
Uh	0
Well some of those	0
are subsumed by approach.	0
Would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it?	0
Yeah, would be a f- for a given segment.	0
The Charles Bridge, you know.	0
You know, you - y- you go - first go the town square	0
Well I	0
eh	0
No, I mean, if you go to re- you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your - your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge	0
and doesn't really matter which way you cross	0
which - where you end up at the end but the part - the good part is walking over it, so.	0
That's subtle, but true. Anyway	0
so let's just leave it three - with three for now	0
Mm-hmm, mmm.	0
Yeah.	0
and let's see if we can get it linked up	0
just to get ourselves	0
started.	0
O_K, we	0
You'll see it - you'll see something comes up immediately, that the reason I wanna do this.	0
w- well the uh user was uh	0
Right.	0
definitely	0
more likely to enter if he's a local	0
Right.	0
more likely to view if he's a tourist	0
um	0
and then of course we had the fact that	0
given the fact that he's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um	0
We did, but the three things w- that - that it contributed to this	0
in fact, the other two aren't up there.	0
so one was the ontology	0
We'll d- what type of building is it? Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
And the - and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse.	0
What he has mentioned before.	0
O_K, so this is w-	0
Right, so what w- I - what we seem to need here, this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff	1
mm-hmm	0
the way we had been designing this, there were three intermediate nodes	1
uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from	1
the uh	1
user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse.	1
So each of those	0
the way we had it designed, now we can change the design, but the design we had	0
was there was a decision with the same three outcomes	1
mm-hmm	0
uh based on the th- those three separate considerations	1
so if we wanted to do that	0
Uh we can load it up it  you know  very simple.	0
So-	0
would have to put in	0
uh	0
three	0
intermediate nodes	0
and then what you and I have to talk about is, O_K if we're doing that and they get combined somehow	0
uh how do they get combined?	1
But the - they're - they're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about.	1
So this was adjusted for this one mode thing.	0
Oh yes.	0
Yeah.	0
So that's w- w- in our uh in - in Johno's	0
sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to	0
whether a person wants to enter, view, or approach something.	0
Oh, it was called mode, so this - this is	0
m- mode	0
here means the same as	0
Is now	0
this endpoint.	0
endpoint.	0
Right.	0
We can just rename that, yeah.	0
O_K, why don't we ch- can we change that?	0
Alright.	0
You know, but that was actually, yeah unfortunately	0
that was a um	0
kind of an intermediate versio- that's I don't think what we would currently do.	0
Can I ask about "slurred" and "angry" as inputs to this?	0
That's a	0
What - why?	0
Like they're either true or false and	0
The prosody?	0
O_K.	0
they uh	0
oh I see.	0
If the -	1
if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech	1
Mm-hmm.	0
they might be tired or, you know	1
O_K. Drunk.	0
Therefore	0
And, you know, possibly uh	0
Less likely to enter.	0
Hmm.	0
some, yeah.	0
uh I was thinking less likely to view	1
Yeah. But that's- that seems to, yeah. So - so  my advice  to do is - is	1
get this down to what we think is actually likely to - to be a - a strong influence.	1
O_K.	0
Right.	0
But yeah, that was what he had in mind.	0
So let's think about this - this question of	0
how do we wanna handle -	0
so there're two separate things. One is -	0
uh at least two. One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology	0
now what we talked about, and this is another technical thing Bhaskara, is	0
uh can we arrange so that	0
I think we can	0
so that the belief-net itself	1
has properties	1
and the properties are filled in uh from on- ontology items. So the - let's take the case of the	1
uh this endpoint thing, the notion was	0
that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site, you know some kind of landmark	0
is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K, et cetera.	1
So that there'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node	1
and then	1
again as part of the ou- outer controlling conditioning of this thing	1
those would be set, so that some- somehow	1
someone would find this word, look it up in the ontology, pull out these properties, put it into	1
the belief-net, and then the	1
decision would flow.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Now	0
Seems to me that we've sort of e- em-  embedded   a lot, em-	0
embedded a lot of these uh things we had	0
in there previously	0
in - in - in some of the other final decisions done here, for example	0
if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
um if it's exhibiting itself it is a landmark, meaning more likely to be viewed	0
Yeah.	0
Yep.	0
if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this, then it's more likely to be	0
entered.	0
I uh that's - I think that's completely right	0
and um	0
I think that's good, right?	0
So what - what that says is that we might be able to	0
uh	0
take	0
and	0
in particular so - so the ones we talked about were	0
uh exhibiting and selling	0
Accessibility.	0
no, accessibility meant	0
If it's closed one probably won't enter.	0
Or if it's not accessible to a tourist ever	0
O_K.	0
the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it, given that he knows it, of course.	0
Alright. So let me suggest this.	0
Uh	0
w- could you move those up about halfway.	0
Uh	0
The ones that you th-	0
And selling I guess.	0
Yeah, all - all of these if it's fixing things	1
selling things, or servicing things	1
Right.	0
So here - here's what it looks like	0
to me.	0
is that you want an intermediate structure	0
which i- uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of -	0
of uh selling, f- fixing, or	0
servicing.	0
So that it	0
uh	0
that is, for certain purposes, it becomes important but for this kind of purpose	1
uh one of these places is quite like the other.	1
Does that seem right?	0
So we di- if we	0
Basic-	0
you're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision? Yeah.	0
Yes. So if - well it may be more than endpoint decisions, so the idea would be	1
Mm-hmm.	0
that you might wanna merge those three	1
These three?	0
Yeah. Eh ser- s- uh selling, fixing, and servicing.	0
Yeah.	0
What ex- um and so either those is true f- or false?	1
So	0
Uh	0
Uh well it - it - i- here's where it gets a little tricky.	0
Uh from the belief-net point of view it is	0
from another point of view of course it's interest- it's - it's important to know what it's	0
selling or servicing and so forth.	1
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
So for this decision	1
Yeah.	0
it's just uh true or false	1
and in th- this is a case where the or seems just what you want.	0
O_K.	0
That - that if any of those things is true	1
then it's the kind of place that you	1
uh	1
Um more likely to enter.	0
are more likely to enter.	1
So you just wanna have them all pointing to a	0
You could, yeah.	0
summary thing?	0
Yeah, so let's do that.	0
No no, no eh to - to an inter- no, an intermediate node.	0
T-	0
Oh, O_K.	0
That's the p- part of the idea, is	0
Um is - is that the object type node?	0
I d-	0
So are they the - is it the kind of object that sells, fixes, or services things?	0
Well, o- open up object type and let's see what its values are.	0
Oh I just created it, it has none so far.	0
Oh, well O_K first of all it's not objects, we called them entities, right?	0
Yeah.	0
And then we have sort of the um	0
Let's say I put commercial.	0
Yeah, I w- I was just gonna commercial action inside	0
where people p-	0
Well  couldn't I  do - let's do commercial	0
uh	0
landmark	0
and	0
And where was the	0
Well	0
accessible, yeah.	0
accessible I think is different	0
Yeah.	0
cuz that's tempor- that - that varies temporally, whereas	0
Mm-hmm.	0
this is a	0
What would a hotel fall under?	0
I would call that a service, but - but I don't know.	0
Well I mean in terms of entity type?	0
Say w- w- well it's co- I would s- a- a- again	0
for this purpose I think it's commercial.	0
Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business.	0
O_K.	0
Um what does the	0
underscore-T_ at the end of each of those things signify?	0
Um things.	0
So places that service things	0
Uh-huh.	0
sell things or fix things and pe-	0
O_K.	0
places that e- exhibit things.	0
O_K.	0
That also points to entity type I guess.	0
So we're deriving um	1
this - the - this feature of whether the -	1
the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there?	1
Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the	0
Well you could, that's a - that's a choice.	0
entity?	0
O_K.	0
So	0
uh	0
I mean it seems like that's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and	0
you know indoor places that do something else and	0
Yeah, the problem with it is	0
that it sort of	0
putting in a feature just for one decision, now w- we may wind up having to do that	0
Hmm.	0
this i- anyway, this i-	0
at a mental level that's what we- we're gonna have to sort out.	1
O_K.	0
O_K.	0
So, you know what does this look like, what are - what are	1
uh intermediate things that are worth computing, what are the features we need	1
Mm-hmm.	0
in order to	1
make all these decisions	1
and what's the best way to organize this	1
so that um	1
it's clean and - and	1
O_K.	0
consistent and all that sort of stuff.	1
I'm just thinking about how	0
people, human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this and it would probably - you wouldn't just	0
sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that	0
Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things, it can either	0
it must be going on inside or something.	0
em	0
do s- do sell things, fix things, service things, exhibit things, it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things, it's not either or mmm	0
Mm-hmm.	0
certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Many come to mind.	0
Things can be generally	0
um a landmark and be accessible.	0
I_E a - a castle or can be a landmark a- or not accessible, some statue  you know  can	0
Mm-hmm.	0
go inside.	0
O_K.	0
Anyway so let me suggest you do something else.	0
Uh which is to	0
get rid - get rid of that l- long link between who - the user	0
and the endpoint.	0
Could we just move it like this?	0
No no, I don't want the link there at all.	0
Oh, O_K.	0
Because what we're gonna want is an intermediate	0
thing which is	0
uh the	0
endpoint decisi- the endpoint decision	0
based o- on the user models, so what we - we - what we talked about is three separate	0
endpoint decisions, so let's make a new node	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Just as a suggestion maybe you could "save as" to	0
keep your old one nice and clean and	0
so you can mess with this one.	0
Mmm.	0
The old one was not that	0
not that important, I think but	0
O_K, well, not a big deal then.	0
Let's do it then.	0
Well the -	0
Isn't there a "save as" inside of java base?	0
But	0
I can just take this	0
O_K.	0
copy it somewhere else.	0
This was user something or	0
Well this was uh let's p- put it this - let's do endpoint	0
underbar-U_.	0
end	0
point?	0
i- endpoint, e- end poi- this is sa-	0
Ah.	0
it's the endpoint	0
Gotcha, yeah.	0
let's say underbar-U_, so that's the endpoint decision	0
uh as seen through the	0
As related from the user model.	0
Right.	0
So let's - let's actually	0
yeah so lin- you can link that up to the	0
Should I rename this  too? No.	0
uh yeah, so that, I guess that's endpoint	0
uh	0
It's underscore-E_.	0
underscore-E_ for entity, and we may change all this, but.	0
Right.	0
And	0
O_K, shouldn't I be able to move them all? No.  Or - ?   Can I?	0
Mmm-mm.	0
Where? What?	0
Oh I d- eh I don't know.	0
Actually, I guess the easiest thing would move - mo-	0
move the endpoint, well, go ahead.	0
Just do whatever.	0
Wasn't this possible?	0
Well.	0
Yeah.	0
I think you have to be in move mode before	0
Uh-huh.	0
O_K.	0
Good.	0
Right.	0
So now we're looking for user related things that um	0
Yeah. And uh maybe th- maybe it's just one who is the user, I don't know, maybe - maybe there's more.	0
Huh.	0
Well if he's usi- if he's in a car right now	0
what was that	0
people with Harry drove the car into the cafe	0
Never mind.	0
Uh	0
anyway, this is crude.	0
Now but the - now so - so - but then the question is	0
uh	0
so - and - and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology, but then we had this third idea	1
of input from the discourse.	1
Well	0
let's - should we finish this, I mean but surely the user interests	0
Sure, O_K.	0
The user thrift, the user budget.	0
yeah, yeah	0
Well, maybe, I- again, I d-	0
well, O_K, put em in but	0
what we're gonna wanna do is actually uh	0
Well is -	0
Here this was one of my problems we have	1
the user interest is a - is a vector of five hundred values, so	1
um	0
Oh you mean level of interest?	0
That's from the user model, mm-hmm, no not levels of interest but things you can be interested in.	0
Well -	0
somebody else has built this user model.	0
Gothic	0
Oh I see, right.	0
churches versus Baroque	0
townhouses versus	0
So why is it	0
oh it, so it's like a vector of five hundred ones or zeros?	0
Yea- n- is that	0
Like for each thing are we - are you interested in it or not?	0
yeah uh I - I think	0
I see.	0
Hmm.	0
O_K. So	0
uh you cou- and so here let me give you two ways to handle that.	0
Alright?	0
One is um you could ignore it.	0
But the other thing you could do	0
is have an - and this  will  give you the flavor of the - of what  @@	0
you could have a node that's - that was a measure of the match between the	1
Mm-hmm.	0
object's feature, you know, the match between the object	1
the entity, I'm sorry	1
Uh.	0
and the user.	1
So you could have a k- a "fit" node	0
and again that would have to be computed by someone else	0
Mm-hmm.	0
but uh	0
so that uh	0
Just as a mental note	0
uh	0
Yeah, that's all.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And - and	0
should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of - of entering?	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
I mean, we could.	0
And also	0
if it's an expensive place to enter, this may also	0
O_K.	0
Budget.	0
User schedule.	0
Schedule?	0
"Do I have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the Koelner Dome  or do I just have to -"	0
Right.	0
"time to take a picture of the outside?"	0
It seems like everything in a user model a- affects -	1
Well that's what we don't wanna do, see that - se- cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that	1
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
an-	0
Cuz if the, I mean, and if the user is tired, the user state, right, it would affect	0
Well	0
stuff, but	0
Well, but	0
I can't see why e- anything w- everything in the model wouldn't be	0
Right.	0
Well, that - that's - we can't do that, so we- we're gonna have to	0
Yeah.	0
but this is a good discussion, we're gonna have to somehow figure out	1
uh some way to encapsulate	1
that	1
uh so if there's some general notion	1
of for example	1
the uh	1
relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or	1
something like that is - is the uh	1
compatibility with his current state, so that's what you'd have to do, you'd have to get it down to something	1
which uh	0
was itself relatively compact, so it could be	0
compatibility with his current state	0
which would include his money and his time and - and his energy	0
Yeah, just seems like it'd push the problem back a level. Yeah, but	1
Right.	0
It does.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
No but, it's more than that, like the - the more sort of you break it up  @@  like because if you have everything pointing to one node it's like exponential	1
whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it's not exponential anymore.	0
So it yeah, there are two advantages. That's tha- there's one technical one	0
Sh- sh- yeah, -	0
and the other is it - it gets used	0
S- so we'd basically be doing subgrouping?	0
Subgrouping, basically into mo-	0
Yeah.	0
so basically make it more tree like going backwards?	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
But it - there's two advantages, one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential	1
@@	0
Bhaskara?	0
uh C_B_T's, the other is it can be - it presumably can be used for multiple decisions.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
So that if you have this idea	0
Right.	0
of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to	0
the state of the user	0
one could well imagine that that was u-	0
not only is it sim- is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it's used in multiple places.	0
Anyway th- so in general this is the design, this is really design problem.	1
Yeah.	0
O_K, you've got a signal, a d- set of decisions	0
um how do we do this?	0
What do I have under user state anyhow	0
cuz I named that already something.	0
Oh that's tired, fresh, yeah.	0
Maybe should be renamed into physical state.	0
Or fat- user fatigue even.	0
Hmm.	0
That's with a "G_"?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Whatever.	0
Then we can make a user state.	0
What's th- what we're talking about is compatibility.	0
Uh or something, I don't know, but.	0
I guess the - the question uh is	0
It's hard for me to imagine how	1
everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again.	1
Or user compatibility.	0
Oh but	1
the thing is	1
that we uh uh	1
we had some things that	1
uh	1
That don't.	0
that don't	0
The user interests and the user	0
who - who - who the user is	0
are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired	0
broke	0
Sure, but  other  - I thought though the node we're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action, right?	0
the	0
right	0
Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something.	0
Uh maybe not. I mean the - that's the - the issue is um	0
would	0
Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of.	0
And anyway we're gonna have to find some way to cl-	1
uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible.	1
Maybe um if we look at the - if we split it up again into sort of um	0
if we look at the uh the endpoint again	0
we - we said that	0
for each of these things there are certain preconditions	0
so you can only enter a place if you are	0
not too tired to do so	0
and also eh have the money	0
to do so if it costs something	0
so if you can afford it	0
and perform it	0
is preconditions.	0
Viewing usually is cheap	0
or free.	0
Is that always true? I don't know.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Well, with the way we're defining it I think yeah.	0
W- w-	0
but that eh viewing it without ent- yeah view w- with our definition of view it's free	0
cuz you	0
And so is approaching.	0
Yeah.	0
Well what about the Grand Canyon, right? No, never mind. I mean are there - are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to like, I mean	0
never mind, not in the current -	0
No we have to enter the park.	0
O_K.	0
Eh almost by definition	0
Yeah.	0
um	0
paying involves entering, ge- going through some	0
O_K. Right, sure.	0
Right.	0
Uh	0
So let me suggest we switch to	0
another one, I mean clearly there's more work to be done on this but I think it's gonna be more instructive to - to think about	1
Mm-hmm.	0
uh other decisions that we need to make in path land.	1
And what they're gonna look like.	0
So you can save this one as and open up the old one, right and -	0
and then everything would be clean.	0
You could do it again.	0
Why, I think it's worth saving this one but I think I'd - I'd like to keep this one cuz I wanna see if -	0
Yeah.	0
if we're gonna reuse any of this stuff.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Um	0
so this might be	0
What next?	0
Well you tell me, so in terms of the	1
uh	1
Well let's - th- this	0
planner what's - what's a good one to do?	1
go there or not I think is a good one.	1
Uh	0
Is a very basic one.	0
So	0
what makes things more likely	0
that -	0
So	0
Well the fir- see the first thing is, getting back to thing we left out of the other	1
is	1
the actual discourse.	1
So Keith this is gonna get into your world because	1
Mm-hmm.	0
uh we're gonna want to know	1
you know, which constructions indicate	1
various of these properties	1
s-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and	0
so	0
I - I don't	0
yet know how to do this, I guess	1
we're gonna wind up pulling out	1
uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
So that - that the Go-there decision will have	0
a node from	0
uh discourse, and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be	0
as a placeholder for	0
We - we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint.	0
Of - of course.	0
Identified that	0
Yeah.	0
and so	0
again re- that's completely correct, we have the user model, the situation model here, we don't have the discourse model here yet.	0
Much the same way as we didn't - we don't have the ontology here.	0
Well the ontology we sort of	0
Really.	0
said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting, selling, and so forth.	0
So in some sense it's - it's there.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet.	0
Yeah.	0
Um	0
This be specific for second year?	0
Um	0
And - and we probably will have uh	0
something like a discourse for endpoint.	0
But if we do it'll have the three values.	0
Hmm?	0
It'll have the E_V_A values if - if we have it.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K	0
just for starters	0
and here	0
discourse um	0
For Go-there, probably is true and false, let's say. That's what we talked about.	1
um	0
well, I think um	0
we're looking at the - the little data that we have, so people say how do I get to	0
the castle	0
and this usually means they wanna go there.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So this should sort of	0
push it	0
Right.	0
in one direction	0
however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out	0
how to get there	0
without wanting to go there.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And sometimes um people say where is it	0
Mm-hmm.	0
because they wanna know where it is	0
but in most cases they probably	0
Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that you're - you want these two values.	0
Oh yeah, true.	0
So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it's either	0
yep, yay, A_, or nay.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K?	0
And they'll be a y- uh, a user	1
Go-there	1
and maybe that's all, I don't know.	0
Situation Go-there, I mean, because it's - whether it's open or not.	1
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K, good.	0
That definitely interes-  @@	0
Yep.	0
But that	0
now that kind of	0
um what's the word um	0
Hmm.	0
the - that interacts with the uh	0
E_V_A thing if they just wanna view it	0
then it's fine to go there when it's closed	0
whereas if they want to um	0
Right.	0
so	0
Right, so that's - that's where it starts getting to be uh	0
uh essentially more interesting, so what	0
uh Bhaskara says which is completely right	0
is if you know that they're only going to view it then	0
it doesn't matter whether it's closed or not in terms of	0
Mm-hmm.	0
The time of day, right I - well, right.	0
uh uh	0
Mm-hmm.	0
you know, whether - whether you wanna go there.	0
It does matter though if there's like a strike or riot or something.	0
Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter.	0
Right.	0
So	0
yeah, that's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because	0
this - that node by itself wouldn't distinguish	0
Well i- i- it can have di- various values.	0
Yeah, but we eh you - you're right it might not be enough.	0
Yeah, I mean, see I'm -	1
Well, what -  Whoops.	0
I'm thinking that any node that begins with "Go-there"	1
is either gonna be true or false.	1
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Ah.	0
I see that could be.	0
Also, that node, I mean	0
the Go-there s- S_ node would just be fed by separate ones for	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Could be.	0
you know, there's different things, the strikes and the	0
Yeah. N-	0
Like situation traffic and so on.	0
Yeah. Yeah.	0
Yeah, the time of day.	0
So - so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out	0
is what this says is that	0
uh there sh- should be a link, and this is where things are gonna get very messy	0
from the endpoint	0
uh	0
I guess the  final	0
decision maybe the t- they're final re- and, I guess	0
the very bottom endpoint decision	0
uh to the Go-there node.	0
And I - don't worry about layout, I mean then we'll go - we'll go nuts	0
Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
but	0
Mmm.	0
Maybe we could um have  intermediate   node that just the Endpoint and the Go-there S_ node	0
sort of fed into?	0
Could be, yeah.	0
Right.	0
Because that's what we, I mean that's why this situation comes up.	0
Yeah.	0
Well the Go-there, actually the Endpoint node could feed - feed into the Go-there S_	0
Yeah, right.	0
That's right, so the Endpoint node, make that up t- t-	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
to the Go-there then	0
and again we'll have to do layout at some point, but something like that.	0
Now it's gonna be important not to have loops by the way.	0
I was just gonna	0
Uh really important in - in the belief worl- net world not to have loops uh	1
Yes.	0
How long does it take you to - to	0
compute uh	0
No it's much worse than that.	0
It - if i- loo-	0
It - things don't converge, yeah.	0
uh	0
it - it - it - it - it's not def- i- it's not well defined if you're there are loops, you just	0
R- recursive action?	0
you have to	0
there are all sorts of ways of	0
breaking it up so that there isn't	0
uh	0
Uh but this isn't, this is - this line is just coming from over here.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, no it's not a loop yet, I'm just saying we - we, in	0
Mmm.	0
Well, but the good thing is we -	0
no, in	0
we could have loopy belief propagation which	0
we all love.	0
Right.	0
O_K, so anyway, so that's another decision.	0
Uh what's - what's another decision you like?	0
O_K, these have no parents yet, but I guess that sort of doesn't matter.	0
Right?	0
Well, the idea is that you go there, you go comes from something about the user	0
I mean this is sort of	0
This comes from traffic and so forth, yeah.	0
from something about the situation	0
and the uh	0
the discourse is - is a mystery.	0
Sh-	0
Should we just make some	0
Sure, if you want.	0
um	0
if there's parking maybe	0
Mmm	0
Oh who cares.	0
O_K.	0
And if he has seen it already or not	0
Right.	0
and so forth, O_K.	0
Um	0
and discourse is something that sort of	0
should we make a Keith note here? That sort of comes from Keith.	0
Sure.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Just sort of	0
so we don't forget.	0
Oops.	0
Have to get used to this.	0
O_K, whoops.	0
And then also the discourse endpoint, I - I guess endpoint sub-D_ is - if you wanna make it consistent.	0
Um actually -	0
Wh- ah.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Um actually is this the - the right way to have it where um	0
go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of	0
don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because	0
I think so.	0
S-	0
isn't the, I mean	0
uh, hmm	0
O_K.	0
Maybe not, a-	0
But that still allows for the possibility of the - of	0
the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from -	0
Right.	0
That - all that - that kind of decision making happens at the Go-there node.	0
Uh y- you - yeah you - i- you - if you needed to do that.	0
Uh.	0
If you needed it to do that.	0
Yeah.	0
But uh O_K I was just thinking	0
Yeah.	0
I guess maybe I'm conflating that user node with	0
possible - possible asking of the user	0
you know	0
Ah.	0
hey there's a strike on, uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something or	0
Good point, I don't - I don't know how we're going to - t- uh	0
Yeah, so that might not come out of a user model but, you know, directly out of	0
interaction.	0
Right.	0
Uh	0
I gu- yes my curr- you know, don't yeah yeah yeah that's enough.	0
Yeah.	0
Uh	0
My current idea on that	0
would be that each of these decision nodes has	0
questions associated with it.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things	0
O_K.	0
you know, given that you know there's a strike do you still wanna go?	0
Yeah.	0
But	0
uh if you told him a bunch of stuff, then you would ask him do you wanna go? But	0
Mm-hmm.	0
O_K.	0
I think	0
Right, right.	0
trying to formulate the conditional question, that sounds too much.	0
Yeah.	0
Right, sure, O_K.	0
To me.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Alright, but let me - let - let's stay with this a minute because I want to do a little bit of organization.	0
But	0
Before we get more into details.	0
The organization is going to be that	0
uh the flavor of what's going on	0
is going to be that	0
uh as we s- e- sort of going to this detail	0
indeed Keith is going to - to worry about the various constructions that people might use	0
Mm-hmm.	0
and Johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard, so	1
Alright.	0
what's going to happen is	1
that	1
eventually	1
like by the time he graduates, O_K	0
uh they'll be some sort of system	1
which is able to	1
take the discourse in context	1
and have	1
outputs that can feed the rest of belief-net.	1
I j- wa- I - I assume everybody knows that, I just wanna	0
you know, get closure that	0
Mm-hmm.	0
that'll be the game then, so the	0
semantics that you'll get out of the	0
discourse will be	0
of values that go into	0
the various discourse-based decision nodes.	0
And now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff so it isn't by any means	1
uh necessarily a simple	0
thing that you want out.	0
So uh if there is an- and there is mode of transportation	0
And it	0
there's a sort of also a split if you loo- if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said	0
what's the utterance go- giving us	0
Yeah.	0
and then what's the discourse history	0
give us.	0
Yeah, well that, well, we'll have to decide	0
Mm-hmm.	0
That's uh two things  then .	0
uh	0
how much of th- where that goes.	0
Mmm.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
an- and it's not clear yet.	0
I mean it could be those are two separate things, it could be that the discourse	0
gadget	0
itself integrates em as - which would be my guess	0
that you'd have to do	1
see in order to do reference and stuff like that	1
um you've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say	1
I wanna go back there, wow, what does that mean and	1
Mm-hmm.	0
Mm-hmm	0
Now.	0
uh	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Alright. So	0
But is th- is this picture that's emerging here	0
just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry or is it that we get for each -	0
each decision on the very bottom we sort of get the sub-E_, sub-D_, sub-U_	0
and maybe a sub-O_ - "O_" for "ontology"	0
um	0
meta node	0
I don't know.	0
but it might just	0
It could be.	0
could be so this	0
This is - this is getting into the thing I wanna talk about next, which is	0
s- if that's true	0
uh how do we wanna combine those?	0
O- or when it's true?	0
but this eh w- wou- wou- would be nice though that, you know, we only have	0
at most four at the moment	0
Yeah.	0
um	0
arrows going f- to each of the uh	0
bottom decisions.	0
Yeah.	0
And four you - we can handle.	0
No.	0
It's too much?	0
Yeah.	0
Well	0
i- i- it see- i- if it's fou- if it's four	0
things and each of them has four values	0
it turns out to be a big C_P_T, it's not s- completely impossi- I mean it's - it's not beyond what the system could solve	0
but it's probably beyond what we could actually	0
Right, true.	0
uh write down.	0
or learn.	0
Uh but, you know it's	0
four to the fourth.	0
It's pretty big.	0
Uh.	0
Two fifty-six, is that what that	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, I mean it's	0
and I don't think it's gonna g- e- I don't think it'll get worse than that by the way, so le- that's a - that's a good	0
Mmm yeah.	0
But -	0
but four -	0
didn't we decide that all of these had true or false? So is - it's four	0
Uh for go there, but not f- but not for - the other one's three values for endpoint already.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah, I mean you need actually three to the five because uh	0
well I mean if - if it has four inputs and then it itself has three values so	0
Right.	0
I mean it can get big fast.	0
Um for endpoint? No it's - it's sh-	0
E_V- it's the E_V_A.	0
yeah, down here, but	0
this one only has two.	0
No it still has three, E_V_A.	0
No.	0
Since ta- they will still have three.	0
Each - so you're uh uh from each point of view you're making the same decision.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So	0
Mm-hmm.	0
from the point of view of the ob- of the entity	0
Want to view that, yeah yeah.	0
C- sl- yeah	0
Yeah.	0
This - and also, I mean, the other places where, like for example	0
consider endpoint view, it has inputs coming from user budget, user thrift	0
Right.	0
so even	0
Those are not necessarily binary.	1
S- so we're - we're gonna have to use some t- care in the knowledge engineering	1
to not have this explode.	1
And in fact I think it doesn't in the sense that	0
um	0
Read it, you know actually with the underlying semantics and stuff I think it isn't like	0
you have two hundred and fifty-six different	0
uh	0
ways of - of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some  place.	0
Alright.	0
So we - we just have to figure out what the regularities are and	1
and code them.	1
But	0
um	0
What I was gonna suggest next	0
is maybe we wanna work on this a little longer	0
but I do want to also talk about	0
the thing that we started into now of	0
uh	0
well it's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si- same place	0
what rule of combination	0
is used there.	0
So th- yes they - so these things all affect it, how do they affect it?	0
Mm-hmm. Right.	0
And belief-nets have their own beliefs about uh what are good ways to do that.	0
So is it - it's - it's clearer n- clear enough what the issue is, right?	0
Right.	0
So do we wanna switch that now or we wanna do some more of this?	0
R- basically	0
w- we just need to sort of	0
in order to get some closure on this	0
figure out	0
how we're gonna get this picture sort of uh	0
completely messy.	0
Well, here -	0
he- here's one of the things that - that I th-	0
you sh- you - no, I don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface	1
but you - it would be great if you could	1
actually just display	1
at a given time	1
uh all the things that you pick up, you click on "endpoint", O_K	1
Mm-hmm.	0
and everything else fades and you just see	1
the links that are relevant to that.	1
And I  does   anybody remember	0
the GUI on this?	0
Uh d- I would  almost say  the other way to do that would be to open u- or make	0
you know N_many belief-nets and then open them	0
Mm-hmm.	0
every time you wanted to look at a different one	0
vers- cuz uh	0
It's probably pretty easy do it - to do it in H_T_M_L, just -	0
Yeah, but	0
Uh	0
H_T_M_L?	0
Yeah I have each of these thing- each of the end belief-nets be - be a page and then you click on the thing and then	0
O_K.	0
Yeah	0
li- consider that it's respective, but	0
the - well the b-	0
anyway	0
so uh it clear	0
that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gonna be able to read the diagram.	0
Yeah.	0
Alright, so	0
e- we have to figure out some eh eh	0
uh	0
basically display hack or something to do this because	0
anyway	0
I - I - let me consi- suggest that's a s- not a first-order consideration, we have two first-order considerations	0
which is what are the	0
uh influences	0
A_, and B_	0
how do they get combined mathematically, how do we display them is an issue, but	0
um	0
I don't, yeah I just don't think this has been designed to support	0
something like that.	0
Yeah.	1
Yeah, I - I mean, it might soon, if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start	1
modifying it for our purposes.	1
Right.	0
Yeah, and	0
Um I - that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into, but	0
um	0
we have to know what we want first.	0
O_K, so why don't you tell us a little bit about	0
So	0
decision nodes and what - what the choices might be for these?	0
Ah, sorry. I guess that's	0
You can technically wear that as you're talking.	0
Yeah, it's	0
right, I guess I can do that.	0
Darn.	0
Put it in your, yeah.	0
I guess this board works fine.	0
So um recall the basic problem which is that um	1
you have a belief-net and you have like	1
a lot of different nodes	1
all contributing to one node.	1
Right?	1
So as we discussed	1
specifying this kind of thing	1
is a big pain and it's so- will take a long time to write down because	1
for example if these  S  have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have	0
two hundred and forty-three possibilities which is already	0
a lot of numbers to write down.	0
So what um helps us in our situation is that	1
these all	1
have values in the same set, right? These are all like	1
saying E_V or A_, right? So it's not just a generalized situation like	1
I mean	0
basically we wanna just take a combination of - we wanna view each of these as experts	1
ea- who are	1
each of them is making a decision based on some factors	1
and we wanna sort of combine their decisions	1
and create	1
you know, um	1
sorta weighted	1
Hmm.	0
combination.	1
ROVER, the ROVER decision.	0
The what decision?	0
ROVER.	0
All of their outputs combined to make a decision.	0
Hmm.	0
Yeah.	0
Yeah.	1
So	1
the problem is to specify the uh	1
so the conditional property of	1
this given all those, right? That's the way	1
belief-nets are defined, like each node given its parents, right?	1
So um	0
that's what we want, we want for example P_ of um	0
let's call this guy Y_ and let's call these X_one, X_two	0
X_N, right.	0
So we want probability that Y_ equals, you know, for example	0
um E_	0
given that these guys are	0
I'll just refer to this as like X_ um	0
hat or something,  uh  the co- like all of them?	0
Given that for example the data says you know, A_, V_, A_, E_, or something	0
right?	0
Yep.	0
So we would like to do this kind of combination.	0
Alright, so um	0
Is that uh I - yeah, I just wanna make sure everybody is with us	0
I think so, yeah.	0
before he goes on.	0
It's - it's cl- e-	0
is - is it clear what	0
he wants to compute?	0
Right.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
So, right.	0
So	0
Basically um	0
what we don't wanna do is to	0
for every single combination of	0
E_ and V_ and A_ and every single letter E_, s- give a number because that's	0
Mm-hmm.	0
obviously not	0
desirable.	0
What we wanna do is find some principled way of um	0
saying what each of these is	0
and we want it to be a valid probability distribution, so we want it to um	0
add up to one, right?	0
Hmm.	0
So those are the two things that we uh need.	0
So	1
what uh I guess, what Jerry suggested earlier was basically	1
that we, you know	1
view these guys as voting and we just take the uh	1
we	1
essentially take um	1
averages, right? So for example	1
here two people have voted for A_, one has voted for V_, and one has voted for E_, so we could say that	0
the probabilities are, you know, probability of being E_ is one	0
over four, because one person voted for E_ out of four	0
and similarly, probability of	0
so this is probability of E_	0
s- and then probability of A_	0
given all that is um two out of four	0
and probability of V_ is one out of four.	0
Right?	0
So that's	0
step - that's the uh	0
yeah that's the - that's the basic uh thing.	0
Now	0
Um	0
Yeah.	0
Is that all O_K?	0
And that one outcome, that's	0
What?	0
it's X_ -	0
X_one voted for A_	0
X_two voted for V_ and so forth?	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Y- right.	0
Yeah.	0
Yep.	0
Yeah.	0
That's the outcome.	0
S- so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things, which	1
Mm-hmm.	0
may or may not be a good assumption, so that	1
Yeah.	0
Right.	0
Yeah.	0
So step two is um	1
right. So we've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that	0
you know, some w- be that for example, what the um	0
the actual	0
the uh verbal content of what the person said, like what	0
uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than	0
the uh	0
X_one matters more i- than X_two or	0
Right.	0
Sure, so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we've been giving them all weight one fourth	1
so we could replace this by uh	0
W_one, W_two, W_three, and W_four	0
right?	0
Hmm.	0
And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each um	0
X_hat, we just need that the W_'s sum to one.	0
So they can be for example, you know	0
you - you could have point one, point three, point two, and point four, say.	0
That's one.	0
And that'd be one.	0
So that um also seems to work fine.	0
And uh	0
So I jus- just to make sure I understand this, so in this case	0
um we would still	0
compute the average?	0
You'd compute the weighted average, so	1
O_K, so -	0
the probability of	0
E_ would be uh	0
so it'd be	0
so in this case the probability that Y_ equals A_ would be	0
uh	0
Point three.	0
W_ one times - or A_ or - let's see, one  full  quarter times point one	0
e-	0
Not one quarter, so	0
@@  three.	0
No.	0
these numbers have been replaced with point one, point three, point two, and point four.	0
So it would be, in this case	0
So you can view these as gone.	0
you just add up the - Yeah. So it would - it would - in this case, it would be -  probability of A_ would be point three.	0
O_K.	0
Probability of	0
B_ - yeah, B_ would be point three and the probability of E_ would be point four.	0
O_K.	0
Yeah.	0
If that - if that was the voting plan.	0
Yeah.	0
O_K.	0
So, alright.	0
So this is uh step two.	1
So the next possibility is that um	1
we've given just a single weight to each expert, right, whereas it might be the case that um	1
in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable.	1
So	0
the way this is handled is by what's called a mixture of experts, so	0
what you can have is	0
you augment these diagrams like this so	0
you have a new thing called "H_", O_K? This is a hidden variable.	1
And what this is	0
is	0
it gets its input from X_one, X_two, X_three, and X_four, and what it does is it decides	1
which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation.	1
Right?	0
And then	0
these guys all	0
come here.	0
O_K.	0
So this is sightly uh more complicated.	0
So what's going on is that um	0
this H_ node looks at these four	0
values of those guys and it decides in	0
given these values	0
which of these isn't likely to be	0
more reliable or most reliable.	0
So H_ produces some	1
you know, it produces a number, either one, two, three, or four, in our situation, right?	1
Now this guy	0
he looks at the value of H_	0
say it's two, and then he just selects the uh	0
@@  - Yeah, so that's  one  thing you can do, but the  other  - So, are you going to go on and  say  @@  -	0
thing.	0
That's all there is to say, I guess about it.	0
No it isn't. Because the  other  thing you can do is you - So this - in this case, a mixture of experts just picks one.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Right, so you can have a mixture that	0
But -	0
A  weighted  one. So what you can  do,  if you - if you  need  it is to say that - I mean  here  there's a  fourth  parameter. There's a  fifth  parameter.	0
O_K? which is the H_ parameter.	0
So let's suppose the H_ says in situ-  @@  different uh,  alpha.	0
O_K, in situation-alpha, that's the weighting factor, but in situation- beta,  it's some  other  weighting factor.	0
Right.	0
So you still combine these with weight, but the weights aren't always the same.	0
That this guy uh detects for you that this is a situation in which you should weight this  more  or  less.	0
So - so the function of the thing that comes out of H_ is very different from the function of the other inputs.	0
Correct. It's actually s- it - it -	0
It's driving how the other four are interpreted.	0
In- indeed.	0
O_K.	0
