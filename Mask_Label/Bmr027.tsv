@@   Adam, what is the mike that, uh,  Jeremy's  wearing?	0
Is that a  wireless,  or - ?	0
Is that - Does that mean you can't hear anything during the meeting?	0
Should we, uh, close the door, maybe? So it's - Yeah.	0
It - it's a fairly good mike, actually.	0
Well, I  shouldn't  say it's a good mike. All I really know is that the  signal  level is O_K. I don't know if it's a -	0
So I didn't send out agenda items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have  two.  So.	1
So, just to repeat the thing bef- that we said last week, it was there's this suggestion of alternating weeks on	1
more, uh, automatic speech recognition related or not? Was that sort of  the division?	1
So which week are we  in?	0
We haven't  really   started,  but I thought	1
we more - we more or less did  Meeting  Recorder stuff  last  week, so I thought we could do, uh -	0
I thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week  too.	0
But I figure also if they're  short  agenda items, we could  also  do a  little  bit of each. So.	1
I seem to be having  difficulty  getting this  adjusted.  Here we go.	0
So, uh, as most of you  should  know, I  did  send out the consent form thingies and, uh,	1
so far no one has made any -	1
any comments on them. So, no on- no one has bleeped out anything.	1
I don't expect anyone to. But.	0
So, w- what follows? At some point y- you go around and get people to  sign  something?	1
We had spoken w- about this before and we had decided that they have - they  only  needed to sign  once.	1
And the agreement that they  already  signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity.	0
So as long as we do that, we're covered.	0
And how long of an opportunity did you tell them?	0
Oh, so they have a- plenty of time, and y-	0
Given that it's that long, um,	0
Why  was that date chosen? You just felt you wanted to - ?	0
Jane told me July  fifteenth.  So, that's what I set it.	0
Oh. I just meant that	1
that was  the release date that  you  had on the   data.	1
Oh. I - I didn't understand that there was	0
something  specific.  You - y- you had -	0
I had heard July fifteenth, so that's what I put. So.	0
No, the only - th- the only  mention I recall about that was just that July fifteenth or so is when	0
You said you wanted it to be available  then.  I didn't mean it to be the hard deadline. It's fine with me if it is, or we cou- But I thought it might be good to  remind  people two weeks  prior  to that	1
in case, uh - you know, "by the way  this is your last -"	0
We  probably  should have talked about it, cuz i- because if we wanna be able to	1
give  it to people July fifteenth, if somebody's gonna come back and say "O_K, I don't want this and this and  this  used", uh, clearly we need  some  time	1
to  respond  to that. Right?	1
Yeah. As I said, we -	0
I just got one date and that's the one I used. So. But I can send a follow-up. I mean, it's  almost  all  us.	0
I mean the people who are in the meeti- this meeting was,	0
uh, these - the meetings that - in - are in set one.	0
Was my - was my response O_K? I just wrote you - replied to the email saying they're all fine.	0
Right. I mean, that's fine.	0
I - we don't - My understanding of what we  had  agreed  upon when we had spoken about this  months  ago was that,	0
uh, we don't  actually  need a  reply.	0
We just need to  tell  them that they can do it if they  want.	0
I just didn't remember, but -	0
And so no reply is	0
And he's  got  it so that the default thing you  see  when you look at the page is "O_K".	0
So that's very clear all the way down the page, "O_K". And they have two options they can change it to. One of them is  "censor", and the other one is "incorrect".	1
Is it - is - your word is "incorrect"? Which means also we get  feedback  on  if  um, there's something that they w-	0
that needs to be   adjusted,  because, I mean, these are very highly technical things. I mean, it's an added, uh, level of checking on the accuracy of the  transcription,  as  I  see it. But in any case, people  can  agree to things that are  wrong.   So.	0
Yeah. The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor - not ask to have stuff removed because it was  transcribed  incorrectly,	0
And the reason  I  liked it was because -	0
as opposed to, uh -	0
was because it, um - it gives them the  option  of, uh, being able to  correct  it.	0
Approve it  and  correct it.	0
So, you have  it nicely set up so they email you and, uh -	0
When they submit the form, it gets processed and emailed to me.	0
Mm-hmm.  And I wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are Robustness and Meeting Recorder.	0
The German ones will be ready for next week.	1
Those are three - three of those. A different set of people. And we can impose -	0
O_K. I spoke loosely. The - the German, French - Sorry, the German,  Dutch, and Spanish ones.	0
Oh, those are the [MASK]	0
German, Dutch, Swiss and Spanish.	0
That's - that's - that's r-	0
O_K. I'd - I d-	0
Yeah.  It's the other group.	0
I- It was the network -	0
I didn't mean to  isolate them.	0
Otherwise known as the German, Dutch, and Spanish.	0
Yeah. Sorry. It was - it was not the best characterization.  But what -	0
what I meant to say was that it's the other group that's not -	0
n- no m- no overlap with our present members.	0
And then maybe it'd be good to set an explicit deadline, something like  a week  before that, uh, J- July fifteenth date, or two weeks before.	1
I mean, I would suggest we discuss - I mean, if we're going to have a  policy  on it, that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people,	0
so that we have a uniform thing. So, tha- that's a month, which is fine. I mean, it seems -	0
Well, the only thing I said in the email is that  the data is going to be  released  on the fifteenth. I didn't  give  any other deadline.	0
So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says, "wow I suddenly  found  something",	0
we'll delete it from our  record.  We just won't delete it from whatever's already been  released.	0
Hmm. That's a little bit difficult.	0
What else can we do?	0
If someone says "hey, look, I  found something in this meeting and  it's libelous and I want it removed".	0
What can we do? We  have  to remove it.	0
Well.  That's true. I - I agree with that part, but I think that it would - it, uh - we need to have, uh, a - a - a message to them very clearly that	0
beyond this date, you can't make additional changes.	0
I think that somebody  might   request something even though we  say  that. But I think it's good to at least  start  some place like that. So if we agreed,	0
O_K, how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have - if we say two weeks, or if we say a month,	0
I think we should just  say  that - say that, you know, i- a- as  um,	0
"per the - the - the, uh, page you  signed,  you have the ability to look over this stuff" and so forth	0
"and, uh, because we w-"	0
these, uh - I would - I would imagine some sort of  generic  thing that would say "because we, uh, will continually be making these things available	0
to other  researchers,  uh, this can't be open-ended and so, uh, uh, please give us back your response within  this  am- you know, within this amount of time", whatever time we agree upon.	0
Well, did you read the email and look at the pages I sent?	0
Did I? No, I haven't yet. No, just -	0
No. O_K, well why don't you  do  that and then make comments on what you want me to change?	0
No, no. I'm not saying that you should change  anything.  I- I'm - what I'm - what I'm -	0
I'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who  have  read it  so that - that you can -	0
you can, uh,  decide  on something. So I'm not telling you  what  to  decide.	0
I'm just saying you should  decide  something, and then -	0
I already  did  decide something, and that's what's in the  email.  And if you  disagree  with it, why don't you  read  it and give me  comments  on it?	1
Yeah, yeah. O_K, so -	0
I - I think that there's one missing line.	0
Well, the  one  thing that I  did  read and that you just  repeated  to me  was that you gave the specific date of July  fifteenth.	0
And you  also  just said that the  reason  you said that was because someone  said  it to you.	0
So what I'm telling you  is that what you should do is come up with a length of  time  that you guys think is  enough	0
and you should use  that  rather than  this  date  that you just  got  from somewhere. That's all I'm saying.	0
I ha- I have one question. This is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town. But we can make the assumption, can't we? that, um, they will be receiving email, uh, most of the  month.  Right?	1
It - well, it - well, you're right. Sometimes somebody will be  away and, uh, you know, there's, uh - for  any  length of time that you	1
uh, choose  there is some person sometime who will not  end up reading it.	0
That's - it's, you know, just a certain risk to take.	1
S- so maybe when -  Am I on, by the way?	0
You should be channel B_.	0
Oh, O_K. Alright. So. The, um -	0
Maybe we should say in -	0
w- you know, when the whole thing  starts,  when they sign the -	1
you know, how - how they will be contacted	1
and they can, you know - they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address, or both.	0
We  did  that, I - I  believe.	0
A- And, then, you know, say very clearly that if they don't - if we don't hear from them,	1
you know, as Morgan suggested, by a certain time or after a certain	1
period after we  contact  them	1
that is implicitly giving their agreement.	1
Well, they've  already  signed a form.	1
And the form says -	0
And nobody - nobody really reads it anyway.	0
So. And the s- and the form was	1
Well, if that's i- tha- if that's already - if -	0
approved by Human Subjects, so, eh, that's gonna be a little hard to modify.	1
Well, the form - Well, the form doesn't say, if - uh, you know, "if you don't respond by [MASK] -"	0
So what does it say about the - the - the  process  of - of, uh -	0
It doesn't have a  time  limit.	0
That you'll be provided access to the transcripts and then, uh, allowed to  remove things that you'd like to remove,	0
before it goes to the general - uh,  larger  audience.	0
Here. You can read what you already signed.	0
I guess when I  read it, um -	0
I'm not as diligent as Chuck, but I had the feeling I should probably respond and tell Adam, like,	0
"I got this and I  will  do it by this  date,	0
and if you don't  hear  from me by then -" You know, in other words responding to  your  email   once,	0
right away, saying "as soon as you get this could you  please  respond."	0
And then if you - if the person thinks they'll need more time because they're out of town or whatever, they can tell you at that point?	0
Oh, I just - I didn't wanna  do  that, because I don't wanna have a discussion with every  person   if I can avoid it.	0
So what I  wanted  to do was just send it out and say	0
"on the fifteenth, the data is released, if you wanna do something about it,  do  something about it, but that's it".	0
I - I kind of  like  this. Yeah.	0
O_K. So, we're  assuming  that -	0
Well, that's - that would be great if -	0
but you should probably have a  legal person  look  at this and  make sure it's O_K. Because if you - if you, uh,  do  this	1
and you - then there's a  dispute  later and, uh, some -	1
you know, someone who  understands  these matters concludes that they didn't  have,  uh, you know, enough opportunity to actually	1
exercise their - their right -	1
Or they - they might never have gotten the  email,  because although they signed this, they don't know by which date to expect your  email.	1
And so  someone whose machine is down or whatever - I mean,	1
we have no - in-  internally  we know that people are there, but we have no confirmation that they got the mail.	0
Well, O_K. l- Let me - Let me  reverse  this.	0
So let's say someone - I send this out, and someone doesn't  respond.	0
Do we delete every meeting that they were  in?	0
It - we're hoping that doesn't happen, but that's why there's such a thing as registered mail or -	0
Because people don't read their email, or they'll read and say "I don't care about that, I'm not gonna delete anything" and they don- just won't reply to it.	1
Maybe - uh, do we have mailing  addresses   for these people?	1
No. We have  what  they put on the speaker form, which was just generic contact information.	0
But the ones that we're dealing with now are  all   local,  except the ones who - I mean, we - we're  totally  in contact with all the ones in those two groups.	0
So maybe, uh, I - you know, that's not that many people and if I - if, uh -	0
i- i- there  is  an advantage to having them admit - and if I can help with - with processing that, I will. It's - it's - there  is  an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating -	0
Yeah. I mean I  thought  we had  discussed  this, like, a  year  ago. And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up  yet   again.	0
Well, I - you know. But sometimes -	0
Well, we - we haven't  experienced  it before. Right? So -	0
You'll either wonder  at the beginning or you'll wonder at the end.	0
Need to get it right.	0
I mean, there's no way to get around -	0
I- It's pretty much the same am- amount of work except for an additional email just saying they  got  the email. And maybe it's better legally to	0
wonder  before  - you know, a little bit earlier than -	0
It's much easier to  explain   this way. T- t- to have it on record.	0
O_K. Well, why don't you talk  t- Morgan, can you talk to our lawyer about it,	0
and find out what the status is on this? Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't  need  to. Because	0
what - I'm  telling  you, people won't respond to the email.	0
No matter what you do, you- there're gonna be people who  you're gonna have to make a  lot  of  effort  to get in contact with.	0
I mean, i- it's k-	0
Well, then we make the effort.	0
And do we want to  spend  that effort?	0
It's kind of like signing up for a  mailing  list. They have opt in and opt out. And there are two different ways. I mean, and either way  works   probably, I mean.	0
Except I really think in this case - I - I'm agr- I agree with Liz, that we need to be  in the clear	0
and not have to after the fact say "oh, but I assumed", and "oh, I'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you", you know.	0
If this is a purely administrative task, we can actually have  administration  do it.	0
But the thing is that, you know, I - I - I think, without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers,	0
from my  previous  conversations with them, my - my sense very  much is that we would want something	0
on record  as indicating that they actually were  aware  of this.	0
Well, we had  talked  about this  before  and I thought that we had	0
even gone by the  lawyers   asking  about that and they said	0
you have to s- they've already  signed  away the f- with that  form  - that they've already  signed  once.	0
I don't remember that this issue of  the time period allowed for response was ever covered.	0
Yeah. We never really talked about that.	0
Or the date at which they would be receiving the email	0
Or - or how they would indicate -	0
They probably forgot all about it. Yeah.	0
We  certainly  didn't talk, uh, about - with them at all about, uh, the  manner  of them being -	0
We do it like with these -	0
made the, uh, uh, materials available. That was something that was sort of just within our implementation.	0
We can use it - we can use a -	0
a ploy like they use to, um -	0
you know, that when they serve, like -	0
uh, you know, like dead-beat dads, they - they - they make it look like they won something in the lottery  and then they open the envelope and that -	0
Right? Because - and then the - the - the - the thing is served.	0
So you just make it, you know, "oh, you won - you know, go to this web site and you've, uh - you're -"	0
That's why you never open these things that come in the mail.	0
Well, it's just, we've gone from one extreme to the other, where	0
Right. No, it- I - it might -	0
at one point, a few months ago, Morgan was - you were saying let's not do  anything,  and now we're -	0
it - it might well be the case - it might -	0
we're saying we have to follow up each person and get a  signature?  I mean, what are we gonna doing here?	0
It might well be the case that - that this is perfectly -	0
you know, this is enough to give us a basis t- to just, eh,	0
assume their consent if they don't reply.  But, I'm not - you know, me not being a  lawyer,  I wouldn't	0
just wanna  do  that without  having the - the expert, uh, opinion on that.	0
And how many people? Al- altogether we've got twenty people. These people are people who read their email almost all the time.	1
Then I think we had better find out, so that we can find a -	0
Let me look at this again.	0
I - I really don't see that it's a problem. I - I think that it's a common courtesy to ask them -	1
uh, to  expect  for them to, uh, be able to  have	1
@@   us try to contact them, u- just in case they hadn't gotten their email. I think they'd appreciate it.	1
Yeah. My - Adam, my - my view before was about  the nature of what was - of the presentation,	0
of - of  how   my - my - the things that we're questioning were along the lines of how easy -	0
how much implication would there be that it's  likely  you're going to be changing something, as opposed to - That was the kind of dispute I was making before.	0
But, um, the  attorneys,  I - uh, I can  guarantee  you, the attorneys will  always  come back with - and we have to decide how	0
stringent  we want to  be  in these things,  but they will  always  come back with saying	0
that, um, you need to - you want to have someth- some paper trail or - which includes electronic trail -	0
that they have, uh, in fact  O_ K'd  it.	0
I think that if you f- i- if  we send the email as you have and if there's	1
half  the people, say, who don't respond  at  all  by, you know, some period of time,	1
we can just make a  list  of these people and hand it to, uh -	1
you know, just give it to me and I'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever, and they'll just call them up and say, you know, "have you -	1
Is - is this O_K? And would you please mail - you know, mail Adam that it  is,  if i- if it, you know, is or not."	1
So, you know, we can - we can do that.	0
The other thing that there's a psychological effect that -	1
at least for  most  people, that if they've responded to your email saying "yes, I will do it" or "yes, I got your email", they're more likely to actually  do  it   later  than to just  ignore  it.	1
And of course we don't  want  them to  bleep  things  out,  but it -	0
it's a little bit better if we're getting the -	0
their, uh, final response, once they've answered you  once  than if they never answer you'd  at al- at  all.	0
That's how these mailing houses work. So, I mean, it's not  completely  lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting  responses.	0
You know, an official O_K from somebody  is better than no answer, even if they responded that they got your email.	1
And they're probably more likely to do that once they've responded that they got the email.	1
I also think they'd just simply  appreciate  it. I think it's a good - a good way of - of	0
fostering goodwill among our subjects.	0
I think the main thing is - I mean, what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases. So they s- so - so - Tha- that's what they're paid to do.	0
And so,  it  is  certainly possible that, uh, somebody's server would be down or  something  and they wouldn't actually	0
hear  from us, and then they find this thing is  in  there and we've already distributed it to someone. So,	0
what it  says  in there, in fact, is that they will be given an opportunity to blah-blah-blah,	0
but if in fact - if we  sent  them something or we  thought  we sent them something but they didn't  actually   receive  it for some reason,	0
um, then we  haven't  given them that.	0
Well, so  how   far  do we have to go? Do we need to get someone's signature?	0
Or, is email enough? Do we have to have it notarized?  I mean -	0
I- i- i- em- email is enough.	1
Yeah. I mean, I've been through this - I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but I've been through these things a f- things f- like this a few times with lawyers now so I - I	1
I- I'm pretty comfortable with that.	1
Uh. If they submit the  form,  I get it.	0
to look at the - ?	0
If they don't submit the form, it goes in the general web log. But that's not sufficient.	0
Right? Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't  imply anything in particular.	0
Except that you know they got the mail.	0
Mm-hmm. That's right. I - I could get you on the notify list if you want me to.	0
For that directory? O_K, great.	0
So again,  hopefully,  um, this shouldn't be quite as odious	0
a problem  either  way, uh, in  any  of the extremes we've talked about because	0
uh, we're talking a pretty small  number of people.	0
For  this  set, I'm not worried, because  we basically know everyone on it.	0
You know, they're all more or less here or it's - it's Eric and Dan and so on.	0
But for some of the others, you're talking about visitors who are  gone from ICSI,	0
whose email addresses may or may not work,	0
So what are we gonna  do  when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with?	1
I don't think, uh - They're so recent, these visitors. I - and - and I - they're also so -	1
They're prominent enough that they're easy to find through - I - I mean, I - I w- I'll be able to - if you have  any  trouble finding them, I really think I could find them.	1
Yeah. Cuz it - what it - what it  really   does  promise here is that we will ask their permission.	0
Um, and I think, you know, if you go into a room and close the door and - and ask their permission  and they're not there, it doesn't seem	0
that that's the intent of, uh, meaning here. So.	0
Well, the qu- the  question  is just whether - how active it has to be.	0
I mean, because they - they filled out a contact information and that's where I'm sending the information.	0
And so far everyone has done email. There isn't anyone who did, uh,	0
Well, the way ICSI goes, people, uh, who, uh, were here ten years ago still have acc-  have forwards to other accounts and so on. So it's  unusual  that - that they, uh -	1
So my original  impression  was that that was  sufficient,  that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't  accurate	1
Then they just come back.	0
All my files were still here.   Yeah.	0
that  we fulfilled our burden.	1
So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I  will  call the attorney about it. But, you know, hopefully we won't need to.	1
I d- I just don't think we  will.	0
For all the reasons that we've discussed.	0
So we'll - we'll see if we do or not.	0
Yep. And we'll see how many people respond to that email.	0
So far,  two  people have. So.	0
Yeah. I think very few people will and - and - and, you know, people - people see long emails about things that they don't think	0
is gonna be high priority, they typically, uh, don't - don't read it, or half read it.	0
Cuz people are swamped. But -	0
And actually, um, I - I -	0
didn't anticipate this so I - that's why I didn't give this comment, and it - I - this discussion has made me think it might be  nice	1
to have a follow-up email within the next couple of days saying "by the way, you know, we wanna hear back from you by [MASK]	1
and please -", and then add what Liz said - "please, uh, respond to - please indicate you received this mail."	0
Uh, or e- well, maybe even  additionally,  uh, um,	0
"Even if you've decided you have no	0
changes you'd like to make, if you could	0
Respond to the email.  Yep.	0
tell us  that ". Yeah.	0
Mm-hmm. It  is  the first time through the cycle.	0
Right. That would - that would definitely work on me. You know, it makes you feel m- like,	0
if you were gonna p- if you're  predicting  that you might not  answer,  you have a  chance  now to  say  that.	0
Whereas, I - I mean, I would be much more likely  myself,	0
given all my email, t- to respond at that  point,  saying "you know what, I'm probably not gonna get to it" or whatever,	0
rather than just having  seen  the email, thinking I  might  get to it, and never really,	0
uh,  pushing  myself to actually  do  it until it's too late.	0
I was thinking that it also  lets them  know  that they don't  have  to go to the  page  to   accept  this.	0
Right. R- Right. That's true.	0
I mean, I - I - Yeah. So that way they could -	0
they can  see  from that email that if they just write back and say "I got it, no changes",	0
they're off the hook. They don't have to go to the web page and -	0
I mean, the other thing I've learned from dealing with - dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth, uh, is, um,	0
if you say "you've got three months to do this review",	0
um, people do it, you know,	0
two and seven eighths months from now. If you say "you've got three  weeks  to do this review", they do - do it, you know, two and seven eighths  weeks  from now -  they do the review.	0
if we make it  a  little  less time, I don't think it'll be that much -	0
Well, and also if we want it ready by the  fifteenth,  that means we better give  them   deadline of the  first,	0
if we have any  prayer  of actually getting everyone to respond in time.	0
There's the responding part and there's also what if,	0
uh, I mean, I hope this doesn't happen,	0
what if there  are  a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes? Then	0
we actually have to deal with that if we want it to -	0
Ugh!  Disk space, oh my god!  I hadn't  thought  about that.	1
By the way, has - has Jeremy signed the form?	0
That for every meeting -	1
any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of.	1
Just that  channel.  Oh, no. We have to do -	0
Can't you just do that  channel?	0
No, of  course  not. You need  all  the channels.	0
Yeah. You have to do  all  of them,	0
as  well  as all of  these.	0
Do you have to do the other  [MASK]	0
Yes. Absolutely. There's a  lot  of [MASK]	0
You have to do all - You  could  just do it in that  time  period, though, but I guess it's a pain.	0
Well, but you have to copy the whole file. Right? Because we're gonna be releasing the whole file.	0
Well -  I - you know, I think at a certain point,  that  copy that has the deletions will become the  master  copy.	1
Yeah. It's just I  hate  deleting any data.	1
So I - I don't want - I  really  would rather make a copy of it, rather than	1
Are you del- are you bleeping it by  adding?	1
bleep it out and then -	1
it's - it's  exactly  a censor bleep.	1
So what I  really  think is "bleep"  and then I want to -	1
I- I understand, but is - is it  summing  signals or do you  delete the old one and put the new one  in?	0
I delete the old one, put the new one in. There's  nothing  left of the original signal.	0
Oh. Cuz if you were  summing,  you could -	0
No. But anyway -  Yeah.	0
Yeah. It would be qui- quite easy to get it back again.	0
And then w- I was gonna say also that the- they don't have to stay on the system, as you know, cuz - cuz the - the ones -	0
Then someday we can sell the  unedited versions.	0
Once it's been successfully bleeped, can't you rely on the - ?	0
Or  we'll tell people the frequency of the beep and then they could subtract the beep out.	0
You can  hide  it. Yeah.	0
Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version?	0
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yep, that's true.	0
It wouldn't be that hard	0
See, this is good. I wanted to create some  side conversations in these meetings. So -	0
Yeah. You could  encrypt  it,	0
You can use spread spectrum. Hide it.  Yeah, there you go.	0
you know, with a - with a two hundred bit -  thousand bit, uh -	0
Yeah. Yeah. Cuz we don't have enough asides.	0
I have an idea. You reverse the signal, so it - it lets people say what they said backwards.	0
Then you have, like, subliminal, uh, messages, like.	0
ha- you've seen the - this - the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments. Did you read that paper?	0
It wouldn't work. The speech recognizer still works.	0
Yeah. And if you do it backward then -	0
H_- [MASK]  No, it's backward-forward.	0
That's cuz they use forward-backward.	0
Forward but backward. That's right. Good point.	0
Well, I'm sorry if I sound a little  peeved  about this whole thing. It's just we've had meeting after meeting after meeting a- on this and it seems like we've never gotten it resolved.	0
Well, but we never also - we've also never  done  it.	0
This is the first cycle. There're bound to be some glitches the first time through.	0
And, uh - and I'm sorry responding without, uh, having much knowledge, but the thing is, uh, I am, like, one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and - and stuff comes in as	0
Well, and that's exactly why I did it the way I  did  it, which is the  default  is if you do  nothing  we're gonna  release  it. Because,	0
you know, I have my   stack  of emails of to d- to be  done,	0
that, you know, fifty or sixty  long,  and the ones at the  top  I'm  never  gonna  get  to.	0
And, uh  So - so -	0
Move  them   to the bottom.	0
So - so the only thing we're missing is - is some way to  respond   to easily to say, uh, "O_K, go ahead" or something. Yeah.	0
So, i- this  is  gonna mean -	0
Just re-mail  them   to yourself and then they're at the bottom.	0
Yeah. That's actually definitely a good point. The m- email doesn't  specify	0
that you can just reply to the email, as op- as opposed to going to the form and -	0
And it also doesn't give a - a specific - I didn't think of it.	0
S- I think it's a good idea - an ex- explicit time by which this will be considered	0
And - and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint.	0
This - um, I've seen this recently. Uh, I got email, and it -	0
i- if I use a [MASK] it actually	0
says, you know, click on this button to confirm receipt  of the - of the mail.	0
You - you can -	0
A lot of mailers support return receipt. But it doesn't confirm that they've  read  it.	0
No, no, no. This is  different.  This is not - So, I - I know, you can tell, you know, the, uh, mail delivery agent to - to confirm that the mail was  delivered  to your  mailbox.  But - but, no. This was different.	0
Ins- in the  mail,  there was a -	0
Oh, just a  button.  Oh, yeah.	0
uh, th- there was a  button  that when you  clicked  on it, it would send,	0
uh, you know, a actual acknowledgement to the  sender  that you had actually  looked  at the mail.	0
Yeah. Unfor- Yeah, we could do that. But I  hate  that.	0
But it o- but it only works for, you know, MIME-capable - you know, if you use [MASK] or something like that for your n-	0
You might as well just  respond  to the mail. I mean	0
And we actually need a  third  thing. It's not that you've  looked  at it, it's that you've looked at it and - and - and  agree  with  one  of the possible actions. Right?	0
No, no. You can  do  that. You know, you can put this button anywhere you want, and you can put it the bottom of the message and say "here, by - you know, by clicking on this, I - I agree -	0
uh, you know, I acknowledge -"	0
That i- i- my first-born children are yours, and - Yeah.	0
Quick question. Are, um -	0
Well, I could put a U_R_L in there without any difficulty and  even pretty simple [MASK] can do that. So.	0
But why shouldn't they just  email back? I don't see there's a problem.  It's very nice. I - I like the high-tech aspect of it, but I think -	0
No, no, no.  I actually  don't.  I'm just saying that	0
Well, I - cuz I use a  text  [MASK]	0
if ev- but I'm -	0
Wow. That's - that's my guy. Alright.	0
You - you [MASK]	0
So - I - i-	0
There's these logos  that you can put at the bottom of your web page, like "powered by [MASK]".	0
Anyway, quick question. How m-	0
You could put  wed  bugs in the email.	0
Like, there were  three  meetings this time, or so- or how many? Six?	0
But, no- of different people. So I guess if you're in  both  these types of meetings, you'd have a lot. But -	1
How - I mean, it  also  depends on how many -	1
Like, if we release - this time it's a fairly small number of meetings, but what if we release, like, twenty-five meetings to people?	1
Well, what my s- expectation is, is that we'll send out one of these emails  every time a meeting has been checked and is ready.	1
Oh. Oh, O_K. So this time was just the first chunk. O_K.	0
So. Tha- that was my intention. It's just - yeah - that we just  happened  to have a  bunch  all at once.	0
Well, that's a good idea.	0
I mean, maybe - Is that  the way it's gonna be, you think, Jane?	0
I agree with you.  It's - we could do it, uh - I- I could - I'd be happy with either way, batch-wise - What I was thinking - Uh, so  this  one -	0
That was exactly right, that we had a - uh, uh -	0
I - I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready.	0
But, uh, this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable. People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then.	0
My, um - I was thinking that with the  N_S_A meetings, I'd like - there are three of  them,  and they're - uh, I - I will have  them  done by Monday.	0
Uh, unfortunately the time is later and I don't know how that's gonna work out, but I thought it'd be good to have  that  released as a clump, too, because then,	0
you know, they're - they - they have a - it- it's in a  category,  it's not quite so  distracting  to them, is what I was thinking, and it's all in one chu-	0
But after  that,  when we're caught up a bit on this process,  then,  um, I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available.	0
I could do it either  way.  I mean, it's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking.	0
We heard anything from I_B_M?	1
Uh. Let's see. We - Yeah, right. So we got the transcript back from that one meeting. Everything seemed fine.	1
Adam  had a script that will  put everything back together and there was - Well, there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix.	1
And then, um,  we, uh - I sent him a pointer to three more.	0
And so he's  off and  working on those.	0
Yeah. Now we haven't actually had anyone go  through  that meeting, to see whether the transcript is  correct  and to see how much was  missed  and all that sort of stuff. So at some point we need to do that.	1
Well, that's on my list.	0
Yeah. It's gonna have to go through our regular	1
I mean, the  one  thing I noticed is it did miss a  lot  of backchannels. There are a fair number of "yeahs" and "uh-huhs" that - it's just - that aren't in there.	1
But I think - Yeah. Like you said, I mean, that's - that's gonna be our standard proc- that's what the transcribers are gonna be spending most of their time  doing,  I would imagine, once - once we -	0
One question about the backchannels. Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre-segmenter?	1
Yeah. They're - they're  not  in the segmented. It's not that the  I_B_M people didn't  do  it.	1
Just they didn't get marked.	0
O_K. So maybe when the detector for  that  gets better or something -   I w- I -	0
There's another issue which is this - we've been, uh, contacted by University of Washington now, of course, to, um -	1
We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those  six meetings	1
audio files. So they'll be doing that. Chuck's - Chuck's, uh,	1
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I pointed them to the set that Andreas put, uh, on the	0
web so th- if they want to compare directly with  his  results they  can.	0
And, um, then once, uh,	0
th- we can also point them at the, um,	0
and they can grab those, too, with [MASK]	0
Wait. So you put the  reference  files - ?	0
No, no. They d- they wanted the audio. Jane sent them the, uh, transcripts.	0
No, I mean of the  transcripts.	0
Well, we can talk about it off-line.	0
There's another meeting in here, what, at  four?	0
Right? Yeah, so we have to finish by three forty-five.	0
D- d- So, does Washi- does - does [MASK] wanna u- do this - wanna use this data for  recognition  or for something else?	0
I think they're doing w- didn't they want to do language modeling on, you know, recognition-compatible transcripts  or -  ?	0
This is to show you, uh, some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure.	0
So, this is from one of the N_S_A meetings and, uh, i- if you're familiar with the diff format, the arrow to the left is what it  was,  and the arrow to the right is  what it was  changed  to. So,	1
And now the first one. "O_K. So, then we started a weekly meeting.	0
The last time, uh -" And the  transcriber  thought "little too much"	0
really, um, it was "we  learned  too much", which makes more sense syntactically as well.	0
And these - the parentheses were f- from -	0
Oh, this - that's the convention for indicating uncertain. So the transcriber was  right.	0
You know, she was  uncertain  about that. So she's  right  to be uncertain.	0
And it's also a g- a good indication of the - of that. The next one. This was about, uh, Claudia and  she'd been really b- busy with stuff, such as  waivers.	0
Uh, O_K. Um, next one. Um.	0
This was  an interesting one. So the original was "So that's not - so Claudia's not the  bad   master  here",   and then he laughs, but it really "web master".	0
And then you see another type of uncertainty which is, you know, they just didn't  know  what to make out of that.	0
So instead of "split upon unknown",  it's "split in principle".	0
Jane, these are from I_B_M? The top lines?	0
No, no. These are - these are  our  local transcriptions of the N_S_A meetings. The  transcribers   - transcriber's version ver- versus the  checked  version.	1
My -  my  checked version, after I go through it.	0
Um, then you get down here. Um.	1
Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign  language  terms. That's the next example, the  next  one.	1
The, uh, version  beyond  this is - So instead of saying "or",	0
especially  those  words,  " also"   and "oder" and some other ones.   Those  sneak in.	0
Um, the next one -	0
Discourse markers? Sure. Sure, sure, sure. And it's - and it makes sense cuz it's, like, below this - it's a little subliminal there.	0
Um. O_K, the next one,	0
uh,  this is a  term.  The problem with terminology. Description with th- the transcriber has "[MASK] as an advance".	0
But really it's "[MASK] in advance". I mean, I - I've benefited from some of these, uh, cross-group meetings.	0
O_K, then you got, um,	0
uh, instead of "from something-or-other cards",  it's "for multicast".	0
And instead of " [MASK]  system related", it's " end  system related". This was changed to an acronym initially and it should- shouldn't have been.	0
And then, you can see here "G_P_S" was misinterpreted.	0
It's just  totally  understanda- This is - this is a lot of  jargon.	0
Um, and the  final  one,	0
the transcriber had th- "in the core network   itself   or the  exit  unknown, not the  internet  unknown".	0
And it - it comes through as "in the core network itself of the  access  provider, not the internet  backbone   core ". Now this is a lot of  terminology.	0
And they're generally  extremely  good,	0
but, you know in this - this area it really does  pay  to, um - to double check and I'm hoping that when	1
the  checked  versions are run through the recognizer that you'll see s- substantial improvements in performance cuz the - you know, there're a lot of these in there.	1
Yeah. So how often - ?	0
Yeah, but I bet - I bet they're acoustically challenging parts anyway, though.	1
Oh, really? Uh, it's - Oh, so it's just jargon.	1
It's jargon. Yeah. I mean this is - cuz, you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top-down influences in what you're hearing.	1
And it's jar- it's jargon coupled with a foreign accent.	1
But we don't - I mean, our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow.  So,	1
you know, un- until you actually  get a decent language model,  @@   Adam's  right.  You probably won't notice a difference.	0
It probably won't do any better.	0
But it's - I mean, it's definitely good that these are fixed. I mean,  obviously.	0
Well, also from the standpoint of getting people's approval, cuz if someone sees a page full of	0
uh, um, barely decipherable w- you know, sentences, and then is asked to approve of it or not,  it's, uh, uh -	0
Yeah. That would be a shame if people said "well, I don't approve it because  the - it's not what I said".  Yeah.	0
Well, that's exactly why I put the extra option in,	0
Exactly. That's why we discussed that.	0
is that I was  afraid  people would say, "let's censor that because it's  wrong ", and I don't want them to do that.	0
And then I also - the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other  headphones  because of the problem of low  gain  in the originals.	1
And - and they  very  much appro- they mu- much prefer the new ones, and actually I -	1
I mean, I - I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the - the choice. We'd originally chosen, uh,	0
very   expensive  head- headsets but, um, they're just not as good as these, um,	0
in this - with this respect to this particular task.	0
Well, return the old ones.	0
It's probably impedance matching problems. But -	0
I don't know exactly, but we chose them because that's what's been used here by prominent projects in transcription. So it i- we had every reason to think they would work. Sorry, what?	0
So you have spare headsets?	0
They're  just earphones. They're not headsets. They're not microphones.	0
No, no. I mean, just earphones?	0
I could use one on my workstation, just to t- because sometimes I have to listen to audio files and I don't have to b- go  borrow  it from	1
We have actua- actually I have - W- Well, the thing is, that if we have four people come to work  for a day, I was - I was hanging on to the others	0
for, eh - for spares, but I can tell you what I recommend.	0
No, but you'd - If you - Yeah, w- we should  get  it.	0
Sure. No problem. I just -	0
But if you need it, just  get  it. Come  on.	0
Yeah. If you  need  it. Yeah.	0
They're - they're - they're - they're pretty inexpensive. Yeah.	0
Yeah, I still - I still need to get a pair, too.	1
It'd just have to be a s- a separate order - an added order.	0
We should order a cou- uh, t-	0
I'm using one of these. Yeah.	0
two or three or four, actually. We have -	0
I think I have a pair that I brought from home, but it's f- just for music listening and it's not - Nnn. Yeah.	0
No. Just - just - just - just buy them.	1
Sh- Just get the model number and - Where do you buy these from? Like - ?	0
[MASK] just down the street.	0
You just b- go and b-  Oh.	0
Yeah. They always have them in stock.	0
That'd be a good idea.	0
W- uh, could you email out the brand?	0
Cuz I think - sounds like people are interested. So.	0
It's made a difference in - in how easy. Yeah.	0
I realized something I should talk about. So what's the other thing on the agenda  actually ?	0
Uh, the only one was Don wanted to, uh, talk about	1
u- It's short. I mean, if you wanna go, we can just throw it in at the end.	0
No, no. Why don't you - why don't you go ahead since it's short.	0
Oh, I thought you meant the disk space. Yeah, we  know  disk space is short.	0
The disk space was short. Yeah. That's what I thought too.	1
It's one of these - it's - it's  social  and, uh, discourse level and -	0
I- i- i- it- i-	0
Yeah, it's  great.  Yeah, double - double -	0
Sorry.  See, if I had that little  scratch-pad, I would have made an [MASK] there.	0
Yeah, it was really goo-	0
Uh, well, we'll  give  you one then.	0
So, um, without thinking about it, when I offered up my  hard  drive last week -	0
It was while I was out of town.	0
Um, this is always a suspect phrase.	0
But, um,  no.  I, uh - I realized that we're going to be doing a lot of experiments, um,	0
o- for this, uh, paper we're writing, so we're probably gonna need a lot more - We're probably gonna need	0
that  disk space that we  had  on that eighteen gig hard drive. But,	0
um, we also have someone else coming in that's gonna help us out with some stuff. So -	0
We've just ordered a hundred gigabytes.	1
I think we need, like, another eighteen gig disk  to be safe.	0
O_K. We just need to -	0
Well, we're getting three thirty - thirty-sixes.	0
Right? That are going into the main f- file server. So.	0
Markham's ordering and they should be coming in soon.	0
W- Well. So - so -	0
Yeah. I mean, I guess the thing is is, all I need is to hang it off, like,	1
the person who's coming in, Sonali's, computer.	1
Oh, so - so, you mean the d- the internal - the disks on the machines that we just got?	0
Or we can  move   them.	0
These are gonna go onto Abbott.	0
Onto Abbott, the file server.	0
So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in? O_K. That's fine.	0
Once they come in. Sure.	0
Do - when - when is this planned for  roughly?	0
They should be - I - I imagine next week or something.	0
If you're - if you're  desperate,  I have some space on my drive.	1
I think if I'm -	0
But I - I vacillate between no space free and  a few gig free. So.	0
Yeah. I think I can find something if I'm desperate and, um, in the meantime I'll just hold out. That was the only thing I wanted to bring up.	1
It should be  soon.  We - we should -	0
So there's another hundred gig. So.	0
It's  great  to be able to  do  it, just say "oh yeah, a hundred gig, no big deal".	0
Yeah.  A hundred gig here, a hundred gig there.  It's eventually	0
Well, each  meeting  is like a  gig  or something, so it's really -	0
Um. Yeah. I was just going to comment that I- I'm going to, uh, be on the phone with Mari tomorrow, late afternoon. We're supposed to	0
get together and talk about, uh, where we are on things. Uh, there's this meeting coming  up,	0
uh, and there's  also  an annual report. Now, I never actually - I - I was  asking  about this. I don't really  quite  understand this.	1
She was re- she was referring to it as - I think this actually  didn't just come from her, but this is  what, uh, DARPA had asked for.	0
Um, she's referring to it as the an- annual report for the fiscal  year.  But of course the fiscal year starts in  October,	0
so I don't quite understand w- w-	0
why we do an annual report that	0
She's either really late or really early.	0
Or she's getting a good early start.	0
Uh, I think basically it- it's none of those. It's that the meeting is in July so they - so [MASK] just said do an annual report. So.	1
So anyway, I'll be putting together stuff. I'll do it,	1
uh, you know, as much as I can without bothering people, just by looking at - at papers and status reports. I mean, the status reports you do are very helpful.	1
Uh, so I can grab stuff there. And if, uh - if I have some questions I'll -	1
When we remember to fill  them   out.	1
Yeah.  If   people could do it as soon as - as you can, if you haven't done one si- recently. Uh.	0
Uh, but, you know, I'm - I'm sure before  it's all done, I'll end up bugging people for - for more clarification about stuff.	1
But, um, I don't know, I guess - I guess I know	0
pretty  much  what people have been doing.  We have these meetings and - and there's the status reports.	0
Yeah. So that wasn't a long one. Just to  tell  you that. And if something	0
hasn't,  uh - I'll be talking to her late	0
tomorrow afternoon, and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it's important thing to mention on	0
this kind of thing, uh, uh, just pop me a one-liner and - and - and I'll - I'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation.	0
I guess, uh, you- you're still	0
pecking away at the  demos and all that, probably.	0
And Don is  gonna be helping out with that. So.	0
Did you wanna talk about that this afternoon?	0
Not here, but later today?	0
We should probably talk off-line about when we're gonna talk off-line.	0
O_K. Yeah, I might want to get updated about it in about a week cuz, um, I'm actually gonna have a -	0
a few days off the following week,	0
a- after the - after the picnic. So.	0
So we were gonna do sort of	0
status of speech transcription - automatic transcription, but we're kind of running late. So.	0
How long does it take you to save the data?	0
If you wanna do a quick	0
Guess we should stop, like, twenty of at the latest. We - we have another meeting coming in that they wanna record. So.	0
And  there's the digits to do. So maybe - may- maybe - maybe -  We  could.	0
Yeah. Well, we can skip the digits.	0
Fi- five minute report or something.	0
It's up to  you.  I don't -	0
Yeah, yeah. Well, I would love to hear about it, especially since -	0
What do you have to say? I'm interested, so -	0
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna be on the phone tomorrow, so this is just a  good example of  the sort of thing I'd like to  hear about.	0
Wait. Why is everybody looking at  me?	0
Cuz  he  looked at you and says you're sketching.	0
Uh. I'm not sure what you were referring to.	0
I - I - I - I'm not - actually, I'm not sure what - ?	0
Are we supposed to have  done  something?	0
No. We were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting.	0
And this week we were gonna  try  to do  t- automatic transcription  status.	0
I wasn't here last week. Sorry.	0
We did that  last  week. Right?	0
But we sort of failed.	0
O_K. So now -  now  we have the schedule. So  next  week we'll do automatic transcription status, plus anything that's real timely.	1
A woman of few words.	0
But - but lots of prosody.	0
Uh, I mean, we - we really  haven't  done anything.	0
I mean, the - the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the, um -	1
the automatic alignments because, uh, I got some -	1
I - I - I learned from Thilo what data we can use as a	1
see how well we're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech - or, of the  foreground  speech with background speech.  So.	1
But, we haven't actually -	0
And then, uh, I guess,	1
the new data that Don will start to process - the, um -	1
when he can get these - You know, before we were working with	1
these segments that were all  synchronous  and that caused a lot of problems because you have	1
