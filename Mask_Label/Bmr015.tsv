O_K we're on and we seem to be working.	0
We didn't crash - we're not  crashing  anymore and it really  bothers  me.	0
One, two, three, four, f-	0
I   crashed   when I started this morning.	0
You  crashed   - crashed this morning? I did  not  crash this morning.	0
Oh! Well maybe it's just, you know, how many t- u- u- u- u-	0
how many times you crash in a  day.	0
First time - first time	0
in the  day,  you know.	0
Or maybe it's once you've	0
done enough meetings  it won't crash on you anymore.	0
It's a matter of experience.	0
Do we have an agenda? Liz - Liz and Andreas can't sh-	0
can't - uh, can't come. So, they won't be here.	0
I have agenda and it's all  me.  Cuz no one sent me anything else.	0
uh, the messages to  you  about the meeting today?	0
I have no idea but I just got it a few minutes ago.	0
Right when you were in my office it arrived.	0
O_K, cuz I checked my mail. I didn't have anything.	0
does anyone have any a- agenda items other than me? I actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits.	0
Uh, right, so - so I - I was just gonna talk briefly about [MASK]	1
and then, you have -	0
I mean, I won't say much, but -	0
uh, but then, uh, you said - wanna talk about digits?	0
I have a short thing about digits and then uh I wanna talk a little bit about naming conventions, although it's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it.	1
So maybe just talk about it very briefly and take the details to the people who - for whom it's relevant.	0
I could  always  say something about [MASK]  I've been -  but - but - uh, well -	0
Well if we - Yeah, we shouldn't	0
add things in just to add things in.  I'm   actually pretty busy today, so if we can -	0
we - a short meeting would be fine.	0
This does sound like we're doing fine, yeah.	0
So the only thing I wanna say about digits is, we are  pretty  much done with the first test set.	1
There are probably forms here and there	1
that are marked as having been read that weren't really read.	0
So I won't really know until I go through all [MASK] forms and extract out pieces that are in error.	0
So I wa- Uh.  Two  things. The first is	1
what should we do about digits that were misread?	1
um, we should just throw them out  completely,	0
and have them read again by someone else.	0
You know, the grouping is completely random, so it - it's perfectly fine to put a - a group together again	0
of errors and have them re-read,	0
just to finish out the test set.	0
Oh! By - throw them out  completely?	0
Um, the  other  thing you could do is	0
change the  transcript  to match what they really said.	0
So those are - those are the two options.	0
But there's often things where people do false starts. I know  I've  done it, where I say -	0
What [MASK] did with that is if they did a correction,	1
and they eventually did read [MASK]	1
you extract [MASK]	1
Oh, you're talking about where they  completely  read the wrong string and didn't correct it?	1
Which happens in a few places.	0
Well, and s- and you're talking  string-wise,  you're not talking about the entire page?	0
And so the - the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said, but then -	0
but then the transcript isn't [MASK]  set anymore.	0
I don't think that really  matters  because the conditions are so different.	0
And that would be a little  easier.	0
Well how many are - how - how often does that happen?	0
Mmm, five or six times.	0
Oh, so it's not very much.	0
No, it's not much at all.	0
Seems like we should just change the  transcripts	1
Yeah, it's five or six times out of  thousands?	0
Four thous- Ah! Four thousand.	0
Yeah, I would, uh,  tak- do the easy way,  yeah.	0
It - it's kinda nice - I mean, wh- who knows what	0
studies people will be doing on - on speaker-dependent things and so I think having -	0
we had is - is	0
how many digits have been	1
Four thousand lines. And each line	1
is between one and about ten digits. I didn't -	1
I didn't compute the average. I think the average was around four or five.	0
So that's a couple hours of -	1
Which is a yeah reasonable - reasonable test set.	0
And, Jane, I  do  have a set of forms which  I  think you have  copies  of somewhere.	0
Yeah, I was just wond-	0
I thought I had -	0
had all of them back from you.	0
And then the other thing is that,	1
uh, the forms in front of us here that we're gonna read later,	1
were suggested by Liz because she wanted to elicit some different [MASK] from digits.	1
And so, uh, I just wanted people to,	0
Eight eight two two two nine.	0
take a quick look at the instructions and the way it wa- worked and see if it makes sense and if anyone has any comments on it.	0
was to continue with uh the words rather than the - the numerics.	1
although we could switch it  back.  The problem was [MASK] and zero.	1
Although we could switch it back and tell them always to say "zero" or always to say [MASK]	0
But it's just two thing - ways that you can  say  it.	1
um, that's the only thought I have because if you t- start talking about these, you know u- tr-	0
She's trying to get at natural groupings,	1
but it - there's - there's nothing natural about reading	1
I mean if you saw a telephone number you would never see it this way.	0
The - the problem  also  is she  did  want to stick with digits. I mean I'm speaking  for  her since she's not here.	0
But, um, the other problem we were  thinking  about is if you just put the numerals,	1
they might say forty-three instead of four three.	1
Well, if there's  space,  though,  between  them. I mean, you can -	0
With - when you  space  them  out  they don't look like, uh,	0
Well, she and I were talking about it, and she felt that	0
it's very, very natural to do that sort of	0
She's  right. It's - it - it's a different problem.	0
I mean it's a - it's a - it's an interesting problem - I mean,	0
we've  done  stuff with numbers before, and yeah sometimes people - If you say	0
s- "three nine eight one" sometimes people  will  say "thirty-nine eighty-one" or "three hundred -	0
three hundred eighty-nine one", or -  I  don't think they'd say  that,  but -	0
Not very frequently but,  they certainly could.	0
Uh, th- thirty-eight ninety-one is probably how they'd	0
So. I mean, this  is  something that Liz and I spoke about and, since	0
this was something that Liz asked for  specifically,	0
I  think   we need to defer to her.	0
O_K. Well, we're probably gonna be collecting meetings for a while and if we decide we still wanna do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver- different versions, but this is the next suggestion, so.	1
O_K, so uh e- l- I guess, let me, uh,	1
get my - my short thing out about	1
actually this is maybe a little side thing. Um, I -	0
we had, uh, in some previous mail, as the right	0
joint thing to send to, which was "M_ - [MASK]	0
But then I got some sort of funny mail saying that the moderator was going to -	0
That's because they set the one up at U_W - that's not on our side, that's on the U_dub  side.	0
And so U_- U_W set it up as a moderated list.	0
And, I have no idea whether it actually ever goes to anyone so you might just wanna mail to Mari	0
No - no, th- I got - I got, uh, little excited notes from Mari and Jeff and so on, so it's -	0
So the moderator actually  did   repost  it.	0
Cuz  I  had sent one earlier - Actually the  same  thing happened to me - I had sent one earlier.	0
"You'll be informed" and then I was never informed but I got replies from people indicating that they  had  gotten it, so.	0
It's just to prevent spam.	0
Yeah so O_ - O_K. Well, anyway, I guess - everybody here - Are y- are -	0
you  are  on that list, right? So you got the note? Yeah? O_K.	0
a, uh, proposal that we put in	1
more - more higher level,	1
from - I guess higher level from my point of view.  Uh,	0
so is i- for - it was a  proposal for [MASK] uh,  Information   Technology Research program's part of National Science Foundation.	1
It's the  second year of their	1
uh, these grants. They're - they're -	1
a lot of  them   are -	0
some  of them anyway, are larger -  larger  grants than the usual, small N_S_F grants, and.	0
So, they're very competitive, and they have a	1
first phase where you put in pre-proposals, and we -	1
And so th- the -	1
the next phase will be - we'll actually be doing a larger proposal.	1
And I'm - I - I hope to be doing very little of it.	0
uh,  which was also true for the pre-proposal, so.	0
Uh, there'll be bunch of people working on it.	0
When's - when's the full proposal due?	0
Uh, I think April ninth, or something.	0
So it's about a month.	0
And they said end of business day you could check on the reviewer forms,  is that -	0
I've been a day off all week.	0
I guess that's a good thing cuz that way I got my papers done early.	0
It would be interesting -	0
So that's  amazing  you showed up at this  meeting!	0
It  is.  It  is  actually  quite  amazing.	0
It'll be  interesting  to see the reviewer's  comments.	0
My  favorite  is was when - when - when  one  reviewer says, uh, "you know, this should be far more detailed", and the nex- the next reviewer says, "you know, there's  way  too much detail".	0
"this is way too general", and the other reviewer says, "this is way too specific".	0
"This is way too hard", "way too easy".	0
We'll  see. Maybe there'll be something useful. And - and, uh -	0
the first gate was pretty easy.  Is that right?	0
That they didn't reject a  lot  of the pre-proposals?	0
Do you know anything about the numbers?	0
It's just from his message it sounded like that.	0
there was a sentence at the end of one of his paragraphs I -	0
I should go back and look. I didn't - I don't think that's true.	0
He said the next phase'll be very,	0
competitive  because we didn't want to weed out	0
much in the first phase.	0
Or something like that, so.	0
Well we'll have to see what the numbers are.	0
they have to weed out enough so that they have enough	0
So, uh, you know, maybe they didn't r- weed out as much as usual, but it's - it's usually a pretty -	0
But it - Yeah. It's - it's certainly not -	0
I'm  sure  that it's not down to one in  two  or something	0
of what's left. I'm sure it's,	0
How - how many awards are there, do you know?	0
numbers of w- awards for different size - They have  three  size grants.	1
See the  small  ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years and  that  they have a fair number of them.	0
and the large ones are,	0
boy, I forget, I think,	0
more than a million and a half, more than two million or something like that.	0
And - and we're in the middle -	1
middle category. I think we're,	1
uh, I forget what it was.	0
Uh, I don't remember, but it's  pr-  probably  along the li- I - I could be wrong on this	0
yeah, but  probably  along the lines of fifteen or - that they'll fund, or twenty.	0
I mean when they - Do you - do you know how many they funded when they f- in - in Chuck's,	0
I don't - I don't know.	0
I thought it was  smaller,  that it was like four or five, wasn't it?	0
Uh it doesn't matter, we'll find out one way or another.	0
I mean last time I  think  they just had two categories, small and big, and this time they came up with a middle one, so it'll -	0
there'll be more of them	0
that they fund than -	0
If we end up getting	0
what will it mean to ICSI in terms of,	0
w- wh- where will the money go to, what would we be doing with it?	0
Exactly what we say in the proposal.	0
I - I mean uh which part is ICSI though. I mean -	0
You know, it - i-	0
None of it will go for those yachts that we've talking about.	0
no, I mean it's - u-	0
It's just for the research - to continue the research on the Meeting Recorder stuff?	0
It's  extending  the research, right? Because the other -	1
Yeah it's go-  higher  level	1
stuff than we've been talking about for Meeting Recorder.	1
Yeah the other things that we have, uh,	0
uh,  especially  with the newer things - with the	0
more [MASK]things are -	0
are - are - are lower level.	0
uh, mapping on the level of - of, um,	1
So it's all- it's all stuff that none-  none  of us are doing right now,	0
or none of us are  funded  for, so it's -	0
so it's - it would be new.	0
So assuming everybody's completely busy now,	0
it means we're gonna hafta,	0
Well there's evenings, and there's weekends, and -	0
Yeah,  there - there would be - there would be new hires, and - and there - there would be expansion, but,	1
for  everybody  there's - there's always things that are dropping off, grants that are ending, or other things that are ending, so,	0
there's a  continual need to -	0
to bring in new things. But -	0
but there  definitely  would be new -	0
students, and so forth, both at - at U_W and here.	0
Are there any students in your  class  who are	0
Other than the one who's already here.	0
I mean we got  - we have -	0
yeah, two of them are - two in the c-	0
There're  two in the class already here, and then -	0
and - and, uh -	0
uh, then there's a third who's doing a project here,	0
who, uh - But he - he - he won't be in the country that long, and,	0
Actually  there  is  one other guy who's looking - that - that's that	0
Anyway, yeah that's - that's all I was gonna say is that -	0
that that's - you know, that's nice and we're sorta preceding to the next step, and,	1
it'll mean some more work, uh, you know, in -	1
in March in getting the proposal out, and then,	1
it's, uh, you know -	0
Uh, the last one was - that you had there,  was about naming?	1
It just, uh - we've been cutting up	0
in - for ba- both digits and for, uh, doing recognition.	0
And Liz had some suggestions on naming and it just brought up	0
hasn't really been resolved about naming.	0
one thing she would  like  to have is for all the names to be the same length	1
so that  sorting  is easier.	0
same number of characters so that when you're sorting filenames you can	1
easily extract out bits and pieces that you want. And that's easy enough to do.	0
And I  don't   think we have so many meetings that that's a big deal just to change the names.	1
uh, instead of calling it	0
Just so that they're - they're all the same length.	0
do things like that you can  always  -	0
as long as you have -	0
uh, you can always search from the beginning or the  end  of the string. You know, so "zero zero two" -	0
The problem is that they're a  lot  of fields.	0
Alright, so we - we have th-	0
we're gonna have the speaker I_D,	0
Yeah, well, your example was really -	0
information on the microphones,  information   on the speak- on the channels and all that.	0
And so if each one of those is a fixed length,	0
the sorting becomes a lot easier.	0
She wanted to keep  them	0
the same lengths across different meetings also.  So like,	0
[MASK] meeting lengths,  all filenames are gonna be the same length	0
And as I said, the- it's - we just don't have that many	0
that that's a big deal.	0
at some point we have to	0
take a few days off,	0
let [MASK] have a few days off, make sure no one's touching the data and reorganize the file structures.	0
And when we do that we can also rationalize some of the naming.	0
I - I would  think  though that the transcribe - the  transcripts   themselves wouldn't need to have such lengthy names.	0
So, I mean, you're dealing with a different domain there, and with start and end times and all that, and	0
Right. So the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names, I would change them to match. So instead of being [MASK] it would b	0
So for - for m- the  meetings  we were thinking about three letters and three numbers	1
Uh, for  speakers,  M_ or F_ and then three numbers,	1
For, uh - and, uh,	1
that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker  database  so that we get those links back and forth	1
and then, uh, the  microphone  issues. We want some way of specifying,	1
more than looking in the " key " file,	1
what channel and what mike.	1
What channel, what mike, and	1
broadcaster.  Or - I don't know how to s-  say  it. So I mean with  this  one it's	1
this particular  headset  with this particular  transmitter  w-  as a  wireless.	0
And you know that one is a  different  headset and different channel.	0
And so we just need some naming conventions on that.	1
that's gonna  become   especially important once we start changing the microphone set-up. We have some new microphones that I'd like to start trying out,	0
And then we'll - we'll need to specify that somewhere. So I was just gonna do a fixed list	1
of, uh, microphones and types.	1
So, as I said -	0
since we have such a short agenda list I guess I wi- I  will  ask how - how are the transcriptions going?  Yeah.	1
The - the news is that I've - I uh -	0
s- So - in s- um -	0
So I've  switched  to -	0
I - I switched to doing the channel-by- channel  transcriptions to provide, uh,	1
the - uh, tighter  time  bins for - partly for use in Thilo's work and also it's of relevance to other people in the project.	1
I discovered in the process	0
a couple of - of interesting things, which, um,	0
one of them is that, um,	1
it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this,  uh,	1
using an interface that has so much more complexity to it.	1
And I - and I wanted to maybe ask, uh, Chuck to help me with some of the questions of efficiency. Maybe - I was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run may be to give them	1
parts and then piece them together later. And I - I have a script, I can piece them together. I mean, so it's like, I - I know that	1
I can take them apart and put them together and I'll end up with the representation which is where the real power of that interface is.	0
And it may be that it's  faster  to transcribe a channel at a time with only one,	1
uh, sound file and one,	1
uh, set of - of, uh,	1
I'm a little confused. I thought that -	0
one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than -	0
uh, the - the other transcription,	0
uh, thing was that -	0
that we were using the mixed  file.	0
when you have an  overlap,	1
you only have a - a choice of one	1
start and end time for that entire overlap,	1
which means that you're not tightly,	1
uh, tuning the individual  parts  th- of that overlap by different  speakers.  So someone may have only	0
said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap.	0
And for purposes of -	1
of, uh, things like -	1
well, so things like training the	1
[MASK] thing. Th- it's necessary to have it more tightly  tuned  than that.	1
And w- and w- and, you know, is- a-	0
It would be  wonderful  if,	0
uh, it's possible  then  to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels  after  that	0
but, um, you know, I've -	0
I- I don't know exactly where  that's  going at this point.	0
But m- I was experimenting  with  doing this by hand and	0
I really  do  think that it's  wise  that we've  had  them start the way we have with,	1
uh, m- y- working off the mixed signal, um,	1
doesn't require them to do the ti-	1
uh, [MASK] for every single [MASK] at a t- uh,	1
Um, I  did  discover a couple  other  things by  doing  this though, and  one  of them is that, um,	0
um, once in a while [MASK]  will be overlooked by	1
[MASK] could well happen in a very densely populated overlap.	0
And if we're gonna study types of  overlaps,  which is what I wanna do, an analysis of that,	1
then that really does require listening  to every single [MASK] all the way through the entire	1
length for all the different  speakers.  Now, for only  four  speakers, that's not gonna be too much time, but if it's  nine  speakers, then	1
that i- that  is  more time. So it's li- you know, kind of wondering - And I think  again  it's like	1
this - it's really valuable that Thilo's working on the [MASK]  because maybe,	1
um, we can close in on that wi-  without  having to actually  go  to the time that it would take to listen to every single  [MASK] from start to finish through every single  meeting.	1
Yeah, but those [MASK] will always be a problem I think. Uh especially if they're	1
really short and they're not very loud and so	1
it - it can - it - it will  always  happen that also [MASK] will  miss  some of them, so.	1
Well so then - then, maybe the answer is to,	1
uh, listen especially  densely  in places of overlap, just so that they're - they're not being	1
overlooked because of that, and count on accuracy during the sparser phases. Cuz there are large s- spaces of the - That's a good point.	0
There are large spaces where there's no overlap at all. Someone's giving a presentation, or	0
whatever. That's - that's a good - that's a good thought.	0
And, um, let's see, there was one other thing I was gonna say.	0
I - I think it's really interesting data to work with, I have to say, it's very enjoyable.	0
I- really, not - not a problem spending time with these data. Really interesting.	0
And not just because I'm in there.	0
well I think it's a short meeting.	0
Uh, you're - you're - you're still in the midst of	0
what you're  doing   from what  you described last time, I assume, and -	0
I haven't results, eh, yet but, eh,	0
I - I'm continue working with the mixed signal	1
after the - the last experience.	1
and I'm tried to -	1
to, uh, adjust the -	1
But I have problem because, eh,	0
harmonic - possi-  possible  harmonics, uh,	0
eh, and now I'm - I'm -	1
some kind of a, um -	1
and other fre- [MASK] that, eh,	1
eh, I have to -	1
to talk with y- with  you,  with the group,	1
eh, about [MASK]	1
t- t- results - similar results,	0
like, eh, the paper, eh,	0
that I - I am following.	0
the - the rules, eh,	0
that, eh, people  used   in the paper	0
to distinguish [MASK] is -	0
And I - I - I - I not sure that i-	0
the way - o- to - ob- the way to obtain	0
the - [MASK] is  right,	0
or it's - it's not right. Eh,	0
I haven't enough file- feeling to -	0
Yeah, I'd like to talk with you about it. If - if - if, uh - If I don't have enough time and y-	0
you wanna discuss with someone else - some- someone else	0
besides us that you might want to talk to, uh, might be Stephane.	0
I talked with Stephane and - and Thilo and,	0
Yeah and - and Thilo, yeah.	0
I'm not too experienced with  [MASK] and -	0
they think that  the experience is not enough to -	0
Is - is this the algorithm where you hypothesize a fundamental, and then	0
No, no it's - No -	0
get the energy for all [MASK] of that fundamental?	0
And then hypothesize a  new  fundamental and get the energy -	0
No. I - I - I - I don't proth- process the - the fundamental. I -	1
I calculate the - [MASK]	1
The algorithm said that, eh,	0
if you - if you change the - the -	0
the X_- the frequency "[MASK]	0
eh, using the in- [MASK]	0
you can find, eh, how, eh, in several frequencies	0
that proba- probably the - the harmonics, eh,	0
the errors of [MASK] -	0
eh, move around  these, eh -	0
And,  eh, if you - if you compare the - [MASK]  eh,	0
of the - of [MASK]	0
that, eh - that, eh, they  used   eh, to -  to - to get, eh, the -	0
it probably too, you can find,	0
eh, that [MASK]	0
eh - the output of [MASK]	0
And in  my case - i- in -  equal  with our signal,	0
Yeah. I'd hafta look at that and think about it. It's - it's -	0
it's - I haven't worked with that either so I'm not sure -	0
the simple-minded way I suggested was what Chuck was just saying, is that you could make a - a sieve.	0
You know, y- you actually say that here is -	0
let's hypothesize that it's [MASK] or [MASK] and -	0
and, uh, maybe you - maybe you could use some other	0
short cut it by - by uh, making some guesses, but -	0
make some guesses from, uh - from [MASK] or something but - but then,	1
given those guesses, try, um,	1
only looking at the energy at multiples	1
of the - of [MASK]	1
and - and see how much of the -	0
take the one that's maximum.	1
Using the energy of the - of the multiple of [MASK]	0
Of all [MASK] of that. Yeah.	0
Do you hafta do some kind of, uh, [MASK] before you do that?	0
I - I know many people use, eh, [MASK]	0
to - to - to get, eh, the pitch.	0
To  get  the pitch,  yeah.	0
To get the pitch, yes.	0
But [MASK] are gonna be,	0
I don't know what the right word is. Um,	0
they're gonna be dampened by the	0
The response of [MASK]	0
just looking at the  energy  on those - at [MASK]	0
is that gonna - ?	0
Well so the thing is that	0
This is for, uh, a, um -	0
I m- what you'd  like  to do is get  rid  of the effect of [MASK] Right?	0
And just look at the -	0
at the signal coming out of [MASK]	0
But, uh - but I - but -	0
but I don't know that you need to -	0
but I don't need you - know if you need to get  rid  of it. I mean that'd - that'd be  nice  but I don't know if it's ess- if it's  essential.	0
cuz I  think  the main thing is	0
uh, you're trying - wha-  what  are you doing this for?	1
You're trying distinguish between the case where there is, uh -	1
where - where there are more than -	1
uh, where there's more than one speaker	1
and the case where there's only  one  speaker.	1
So if there's more than one speaker,	0
yeah I guess you could - I guess -	0
yeah you're - so you're not distinguished between voiced and unvoiced, so -	0
so, i- if you don't -	0
if you don't  care  about that -	0
See, if you  also  wanna	0
if you  also  wanna determine whether it's  unvoiced,	0
then I think you want to  look - look at high [MASK]  also,  because	0
the f- the fact that there's more energy in the high [MASK] is gonna be an ob- sort of obvious cue that it's unvoiced.	0
But, i- i- uh -	0
other than that I guess as far as the one  person   versus two persons,	1
it would be  primarily a low frequency phenomenon.	1
And if you looked at the low frequencies, yes the higher frequencies are gonna - there's gonna be a spectral slope.	1
The higher frequencies will be lower energy.	1
I will prepare for the next week	1
eh, all my results about [MASK] and	1
will - will try to come in	0
I haven't enough feeling to -	0
what happened with the - with, eh,	0
and  I - I see [MASK] there many time but, eh,	0
there are a lot of peaks,	0
eh, that, eh, they are  not  [MASK]	0
I have to discover what - what is the - the w-	0
the best way to -	0
Well, but - yeah I don't think you can -	0
I mean you're not gonna be able to look at every frame, so I mean -	0
I - I mean I - I really -	0
I- I really  thought  that the best way to do it,	0
and I'm speaking with no experience on this particular point,	0
but,  my  impression  was that the best way to do it was  however  you -	0
You've used [MASK]  whatever.	0
However  you've come up - you - with your  candidates,	0
you wanna see how much of the energy	0
as  coppo-   as opposed to all of the - all - the  total  energy.	0
And, um, if it's  voiced,	0
I guess - so -	1
so y- I think maybe you  do  need a [MASK] too.  But if it's  voiced,	1
um, and the, uh -	0
fraction of the energy that's in [MASK]	1
that you're looking at is relatively  low,	1
then it should be - then it's more likely to be an overlap.	1
This - this is the idea - the idea I - I - I had	0
to - to compare the - the ratio of the -	0
the energy of [MASK] with the -	0
eh, with the, eh, total energy	0
try to get a ratio to - to distinguish between overlapping and speech.	0
But you're looking a- y- you're looking at -	0
Let's take a second with this. Uh, uh,	0
you're looking at f- at the phase	0
what domain? I mean this is - this is in - in - in - in  bands?  Or - or -	0
It's a - it's a - o-	0
i- w- the band - the band is, eh, from zero to - to four kilohertz.	0
And I - I ot- I -	0
And you just take the [MASK]	0
Yeah. I u- m- t- I - I  used   two m- two method - two methods.	0
Eh, one, eh,  based   on the F_ - eh, F_T_T.	0
to - to obtain the - or to  study  [MASK]	0
from - from the spectrum directly,	0
and to study the energy and the multiples of	0
And another - another algorithm I have	0
is the - in [MASK]	0
based on - on -	0
on [MASK] to -	0
to - to calculate the - [MASK]	0
Eh, uh n- the d-	0
I mean I - I have two - two algorithms.	0
But, eh, in m-  i- in my  opinion  the - the - [MASK]	0
the - the - the  behavior,	0
th- it was very interesting.	0
Because I - I saw  eh,  how  the spectrum  concentrate, eh,	0
around the - [MASK]	0
when I apply the - the rule,	0
eh, of the - in the -  [MASK] of the ne- of the continuous filter in the - the near filter,	0
the - the rule that, eh, people propose in the paper	0
But [MASK] wouldn't that give you something	0
frequency of the - you know, of the - where most of the energy is? I mean, I think if you -	0
Does i- does it - Why would it correspond to pitch?	0
I - I - I not sure.	0
I - I - I try to - to -	0
When   first I -   I calculate, eh, using [MASK]	0
I get the -  the spectrum,	0
I obtained [MASK]	0
And I change  the - the - the  @@ ,	0
Oh, so you scale - you s- you do a -	0
a scaling along that axis according to instantaneous - It's a kinda normalization.	0
Because when - when -	0
I - I use these - these [MASK]	0
eh, the range is different, and the resolution is different.	0
the paper said that, eh,	0
based   in the - in the -	0
to - to calculate the	0
they use [MASK]	0
And, they said that, eh,	0
if  these  peak are, eh, [MASK]	0
or have to be very near.	0
I - I - I - I don- I-	0
I - and I don't know what is the -	0
And I tried to - to put different distance,	0
to put difference, eh -	0
eh,  length   of the  window,	0
eh, different  [MASK] ,	0
and I - I not sure what happened.	0
O_K, yeah well I - I guess I'm not  following   it enough. I'll  probably gonna hafta look at the paper, but -	0
which I'm not gonna have time to do in the next few days,  but -	0
but I'm - I'm curious about it.	0
I- I did i- it did occur to me that this is - uh, the return to the transcription, that there's one third thing I wanted to - to ex- raise as a to- as an issue which is, um,	1
how to handle breaths. So, I wanted to raise the question of	1
whether people in speech recognition	0
want to know where the breaths are. And the reason I ask the question is,	0
um, aside from the fact that they're obviously very time-consuming to encode,	1
there was some - I had the indication from Dan Ellis in the email that I sent to you, and  you  know about,	0
that in  principle  we might be able to, um, handle breaths	0
by accessi- by using [MASK] from the other things, be able that - in principle, maybe we could get  rid  of them, so maybe -	0
And I was - I - I don't know, I mean we had this an- and I didn't - couldn't get back to you, but the question of whether	1
it'd be possible to eliminate them from the audio signal, which would be the ideal situation, cuz -	1
I don't know - think it'd be ideal.	1
We- See, we're - we're dealing with real speech and we're trying to have it be as real as possible and breaths are part of real speech.	1
Well, except that these are	0
really truly - I mean, ther- there's a segment in o- the one I did - n- the  first  one that I did for -	0
i- for this, where truly w- we're hearing  you   breathing  like - as if we're - you're in our  ear,  you know, and it's like - it's like -	0
I- y- i- I mean, breath is natural, but not	0
but it is if you record it.	0
Except that we're - we're trying to mimic -	0
Oh, I see what you're saying. You're saying that [MASK] would have -	0
uh, have to cope with breath.	0
An- any application may have to.	0
The P_D_ A  might not have to, but	0
P_D_A users are interested in this corpus.	0
O_K, then the - then - I have  two  questions.	0
So - so mean you're right we  could  remove it,	0
I - I think -	0
we don't wanna w- remove it from the  corpus,   in terms of  delivering  it because the - people will want it in there.	0
O_K, so maybe the question is  notating  it. Yeah?	0
Yeah. If it gets -	0
Yeah - i- Right. If - if it gets in the way of what somebody is  doing  with it then you  might  wanna have	1
allow you to  block  it, but you - it's real data.	1
You don't wanna b- but you don't -	0
If s- you know, if there's a little bit of noise out there, and somebody is - is talking about something they're doing, that's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting,	0
we have the f- uh - the uh - the - the fan and the - in the projector up there,	0
and, uh, this is -	0
this is actual stuff that we - we wanna  work  with.	0
Well this is in- very interesting because i- it basically has a	1
i- it shows very clearly the contrast between,	1
uh, speech recognition research and discourse research because in - in discourse and linguistic research, what counts is what's communit- communicative.	1
And - breath, you know, everyone breathes, they breathe all the time. And once in a while breath is communicative, but	0
r- very rarely. O_K, so now, I had a discussion with Chuck about the data structure and the idea is that	1
the transcripts will - that - get stored as a master- there'll be a master transcript which has in it everything that's needed for  both  of these uses.	1
And the one that's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts. You know, like, Don's been writing scripts and - and,	1
uh, to process it for the speech recognition side. Discourse side will  have this - this side over he- the - we- we'll have a s- ch-	0
Sorry, not being very fluent here.  But,	0
um, this - the discourse side will have a script which will stri- strip away the things which are non-communicative.	0
O_K. So then the - then - let's - let's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths. So	1
what I would wonder is would it be possible to encode  those   automatically?  Could we get a  breath   detector?	1
Oh, just to save the  transcribers	0
Well, I mean, you just have no idea. I mean, if you're getting a breath several times every minute,	0
and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate, to put the boundaries in, to - to type it in,	0
i- it's just a huge amount of time. And you wanna be sure it's used, and you wanna be sure it's done as efficiently as possible, and if it can be done automatically, that would be ideal.	0
what if you put it in but didn't put the boundaries?	1
So you just know it's between these other things, right?	0
Well, O_K. So now there's - there's another - another possibility which is, um, the time boundaries could mark off words	0
And that would be extremely time-effective, if that's sufficient.	0
Yeah I mean I'm think- if it's too - if it's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se,	1
we  are  gonna be building up  models  for these things and these things  are  somewhat self- aligning,  so if - so,	1
we - i- i- if we say there is some kind of a  thing  which we call a "breath" or a "breath-in" or "breath-out",	1
the models will learn that sort of thing.	1
Uh, so - but you - but you do want  them	1
where - where the breaths really  are.	1
O_K. But that would maybe include a pause as well, and that wouldn't be a problem to have it, uh, pause plus breath plus laugh plus	0
Well, there's a- there's -	0
You know there is -	0
there's this dynamic tension between - between marking absolutely everything, as you know, and - and -	0
marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods.	0
Basically the  more  we can mark the  better.	0
But if there seems to be a  lot  of effort for a  small  amount of reward in some area, and this might be one like this -	0
Although I - I - I'd be interested to h- get - get input from Liz and Andreas on this to see if they - Cuz they've- they've got lots of experience with the breaths in - in, uh,	0
They have lots of experience with breathing?	0
uh, their transcripts.  Actually  -	0
Well,  yes they do, but we -	0
we can handle that without them here. But - but -	0
but, uh, you were gonna say something about -	0
Yeah, I - I think, um, one possible way that we could handle it is that,	0
you know, as [MASK] are going through, and if they get a hunk of	0
speech that they're gonna transcribe,	0
u- th- they're gonna transcribe it because there's words in there or whatnot. If there's a breath in  there,	0
That's what they've been doing. So, within an overlap segment, they - they do this.	0
Right. But if there's a big hunk of speech, let's say on Morgan's mike where  he's  not talking at  all,	0
um, don't - don't worry about that. So what we're saying is, there's no guarantee that, um -	0
So for the chunks that are transcribed, everything's transcribed.	0
But  outside  of those boundaries, there  could  have been stuff that wasn't transcribed.	0
So you just - somebody can't rely on that data and say "that's perfectly clean data".	0
Uh - do you see what I'm saying? So I would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that's outside of	1
Yeah, you're saying it's - uncharted territory.	0
That sounds like a reasonable -	0
Yeah, and that's - that - that quite co- corresponds to the way I - I try to train the [MASK] as I really try to -	1
not  to detect those  breaths  which are not within a  speech  chunk but with - which are just in - in a  silence  region.	0
And they - so they  hopefully  won't be  marked  in - in those [MASK] files.	0
u- I - I wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes.	0
See, in a - in a way this is a really key  point,	0
that for speech recognition, uh,  research,	0
e- a - it's  not  just a  minor  part. In fact,	1
the - I think- I would say the  core	1
thing that we're trying to do	1
of other things that are  not  meaningful.	1
it's not just incidental it's  critical	1
for us to get these other	1
that's  what we're trying to pull the other  out   of . That's our  problem.	1
If we had nothing -	0
if we had only linguistically-relevant things - if - if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words, with different spectral components,	0
and, uh, we - we didn't have noise, we didn't have convolutional errors, we didn't have extraneous, uh, behaviors, and so forth, and	0
moving your head and all these sorts of things,	0
i- i- isn't that  bad	0
right now. I mean you can  - you know it's -	0
it's - the technology's come  along  pretty well. The - the - the reason we still  complain  about it is because is - when - when you have	0
more realistic  conditions  then - then things fall apart.	0
O_K, fair enough. I guess, um, I - uh, what I was wondering is what - what - at what level	0
does the breathing aspect enter into the problem? Because if it were likely that [MASK] would be able to be built which would	0
get rid of the breathing, so it wouldn't even have to be processed at thi- at this computational le- well, let me see, it'd have to be computationally processed to get  rid  of it, but if there were,	0
uh, like- likely on the frontier, a good breath extractor	0
then, um, and then you'd have to -	0
But that's a  research  question,	0
Yeah, well, see and that's what I wouldn't know.	0
And we don't  either.  I mean so - so the thing is it's - it -	0
right now it's just raw d- it's just data that we're collecting, and so	0
we don't wanna presuppose that people will be able to get rid of	0
particular degradations because that's actually the  research  that we're trying to feed.	0
So, you know, an- and maybe - maybe in five years it'll work really well, and - and it'll only mess-up  ten  percent of the time, but then we would  still  want to account for that ten percent, so.	0
I guess there's another aspect which is that as we've improved our microphone technique, we have a lot less breath in the - in the more recent, uh,	1
recordings, so it's - in a way it's an artifact that there's so much on the - on the earlier ones.	1
One of the - um, just to add to this - one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having	0
models for them. I mean, that's what a lot of people do nowadays. And so in order to build the model you need to have  some  amount of it marked,	0
so that you know where the boundaries are.	0
So - I mean, I don't think we need to worry	0
a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a,	0
you know, conversation. We don't have to go and search for them to - to mark them at all, but, I mean, if they're there while they're transcribing some hunk of words, I'd say put  them   in if possible.	0
O_K, and it's  also  the fact that they differ a lot from one [MASK] to the other because of the way the  microphone's  adjusted.	0
Should we do the digits?	0
