Yeah, we had a long discussion about	0
how much w- how easy we want to make it for people to bleep things out. So -	0
O_K. So this is -	0
Morgan wants to make it hard.	0
The, uh, counter is not  moving again. It -	0
It - it doesn't -	0
It doesn't like me, but -	0
Did - did - did it - ? I didn't even  check  yesterday whether it was moving.	0
It didn't move yesterday either when I started it.	0
So I don't know if it doesn't like both of us -	0
It didn't move on me on one other meeting and it did on one and both recorded the same  so .	0
You know, I discovered something yesterday on these, um, wireless ones.	0
You can tell if it's picking up  breath noise and stuff.	0
Yeah, it has a little indicator on it - on [MASK]	0
Oh that's - the gains I've left here as the sort of normal ones, but -	0
So if you - yeah, if you breathe under - breathe and then you see [MASK] go off, then you know  it's p- picking up your mouth noise.	0
Oh, that's good. Cuz we have a lot of breath noises.	0
In fact, if you listen to just the channels of people not talking, it's like " @@ ".	0
What? Did you see Hannibal recently or something?	0
Exactly.  It's very disconcerting. O_K.	0
So, um,  I was gonna try to get out of here, like, in half an hour, um, cuz I	0
really appreciate people coming, and  the main thing that I was	1
gonna ask people to help with today is  to	1
give input on what kinds of database format we should  use in	1
starting to link up things like word transcripts and annotations of word transcripts, so anything that	1
transcribers or [MASK] or whatever put in the signal,	1
with time-marks for, like, words and phone boundaries and [MASK]	1
So, we have this, um -	0
I think a starting point is clearly the - [MASK] which Don brought a copy of,	0
Yeah, I'm - I'm familiar with that. I mean, we - I sort of already have developed an X_M_L format	1
for this sort of stuff. And so the only question -	1
is it the sort of thing that you want to use or not?	0
Have you looked at that? I mean, I had a web page up.	0
I actually mostly need to be able to link up, or -	0
I- it's - it's a question both of what the representation is and -	0
I guess I  am  gonna be standing up and drawing on the board.	0
O_K, yeah. So you  should,  definitely.	0
Um, so - so it definitely had that as a concept. So tha- it has a single time-line,	1
and then you can have lots of different sections, each of which have I_Ds attached to it, and then you can refer from other sections to those I_Ds,	0
so that you start with - with a  time-line   tag.	0
And then you have a bunch of times.	1
I don't e- I don't remember  exactly  what my notation was, but it -	0
Oh, I remember seeing an example of this. Yeah.	0
Yeah, [MASK] equals one point	0
And then I - I also had optional things like accuracy,	0
and then [MASK]  And then,	1
I also wanted to - to be i- to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp.	1
Yeah, so these are arbitrary, assigned by a program, not - not by a user. So you have a whole bunch of those.	1
And then somewhere la- further down you might have something like [MASK]	1
So what  that's  saying is, we know it starts at this particular time. We don't  know  when it  ends.	1
Right? But it ends at this [MASK] which may be somewhere else. We say there's another utterance.	0
We don't know what the t-  time  actually is but we know that it's the same time as this end time.	0
You know , thirty-eight, whatever you want.	0
So  you're   essentially defining a lattice.	1
And then, uh - and then these  also  have I_Ds.	0
Right? So you could - you could have some sort of other - other tag later in the file that would be something like, um,	1
oh, I don't know,  uh,	1
you could either say "time equals a particular time-mark" or you could do other sorts of references.	1
So - or - or you might have [MASK]	0
It's an O_ instead of an I_, but the D_ is good.	0
You like the D_? That's a good D_.	0
you know, so you could have some sort of  type  here,	0
and then you could have, um -	0
the utterance that it's  referring  to could be [MASK] or something like that.	0
O_K. So, I mean, that seems -	0
great for all of the	0
[MASK] and,	0
I - I guess my question is more,	0
uh, what d- what do you do with, say, [MASK]  I mean  you've got all these phone labels, and what do you do if you -	1
just conceptually, if you get, um, transcriptions where the words are staying	1
but the time boundaries are changing, cuz you've got [MASK] or s- sort of - what's the, um,	1
sequence of going from the	1
waveforms that stay the same, the transcripts that may or may not change, and then the	1
utterance which -  where  the time boundaries that may or may not change - ?	1
That's actually very nicely handled here because you could - you could - all you'd have to change is the,	1
um, time-stamps in the time-line without - without, uh, changing the I_Ds.	1
And you'd be able to propagate all of the -	0
Right. That's, the who- that's  why  you do that  extra  level of indirection.	0
So that you can just change the  time-line.	0
Except the  time-line  is gonna be  huge.  If you say - suppose you have [MASK] You'd have - you'd have -	1
Yeah, yeah, especially at the  [MASK]  The - we - we hav	0
Yeah, this - I don't think I would do this for phone-level.	0
I think for phone-level you want to use some sort of binary representation because it'll be too dense otherwise.	0
O_K. So, if you were doing that and you had this sort of companion, uh, thing that gets called up for phone-level, uh, what would that look like? How would you - ?	0
I would use just an existing -	0
Mmm. But - but why  not  use it for phone-level? It's just a matter of - it's just a matter of it being bigger. But if you have -	0
an existing way of doing it.	0
you know, [MASK] or- uh - I- w- I mean this is still the m-	0
It's  [MASK] I don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for.	1
Oh, no. You would use it  only   for  purposes where you actually  want  the phone-level information, I'd imagine.	0
So you could have some file that configures how much information you want in your - in your X_M_L or something.	0
Right. I mean, you'd - y- I - I am imagining you'd have multiple  versions  of this depending on the information that you  want.	0
Um, cuz th- it does get very bush- with -	0
Um, I'm just - what I'm wondering is whether - I think for  [MASK]  this would be O_K.	1
For  lower  than word-level, you're talking about  so  much data that I just -  I  don't know. I don't know if that -	1
I mean, we actually have - So, one thing that Don is doing, is we're - we're running -	0
For every frame, you get [MASK] and not only	0
Yeah, I mean, for something like that I would use [MASK] or -	1
Uh, that's a - well, or something like it. It's ICS- uh, ICSI has a format for [MASK]	1
O_K. That you could call - that you would tie into this representation with like an I_D.	1
Right. Or - or there's a - there's a particular way in X_M_L to refer to external resources.	1
So you would say "refer to this external file".	0
Um, so that external file wouldn't be in -	0
So that might - that might work.	0
But what - what's the advantage of doing that versus just putting it into this format?	1
@@  More compact, which I think is - is better. I mean, if you did it at this -	1
I mean  these are long meetings and with - for every frame, um -	1
You don't want to do it with that - Anything at frame-level you had better encode binary or it's gonna be really painful.	0
Or you just compre- I mean, I like text formats. Um,  b-  you can always, uh, G_zip them,	0
and, um, you know, c- decompress them on the fly if y- if space is really a concern.	0
I was thinking the advantage is that we can  share  this with other people.	0
Well, but if you're talking about one per frame,	0
you're talking about gigabyte-size files. You're gonna actually run out of space in your  filesystem  for one file.	0
These are big files. These are really - I mean -	1
Right? Because you have a two-gigabyte limit on most O_Ss.	1
Right, O_K. I would say - O_K, so frame-level is probably  not  a good idea. But for  phone-level  stuff it's perfectly -	0
Like phones, or syllables, or anything like that.	0
Phones are every  five    frames  though, so.	0
But - but - but  most  of the frames are actually not  speech.	0
So, you know, people don't -	0
Yeah, but we actually -	0
v- Look at it, words times the average - The average number of phones in an English word is, I don't know,   five  maybe?	0
So, look at it, t- number of words times  five.  That's not - that not -	0
Oh, so you mean  [MASK] take up a lot of the - long pause phones.	0
Yeah. O_K. That's true. But you do have to keep them in there. Y- yeah. O_K.	0
So I think it - it's debatable whether you want to do phone-level in the same thing. But I think, a- anything at frame-level, even  [MASK] ,	1
is too verbose. I would use something  tighter  than [MASK]	1
Do you - Are you familiar with it? I haven't seen this particular format, but -	0
I mean, I've - I've  used  them. I don't know what their structure is. I've forgot what the str-	0
But, wait a minute, P_file for each frame is storing __JARGON__a vector of cepstral__JARGON__	1
It's whatever you want, actually. So that - what's nice about the P_file - It - i-	1
Built into it is the concept of  frames, utterances, sentences, that sort of thing, that structure.	1
And then also  attached  to it is an arbitrary vector of values.	1
And it can take different types. So it - th- they don't all have to be floats. You know, you can have integers and you can have doubles, and all that sort of stuff.	0
So that - that sounds - that sounds about what I w-	0
Right? And it has a header - it has a header format that  describes it  to some extent. So,	0
the only  problem  with it is it's actually storing the  [MASK]	0
even though they're always sequential.  And so it does waste a lot of space.	0
But it's still a  lot  tighter than - than ASCII.  And  we have a lot of tools already to deal with it.	1
You do? O_K. Is there some documentation on this somewhere? O_K, great. So,	0
Yeah, there's a ton of it. Man-pages and, uh, source code, and	1
I mean, that sounds good. I - I was just looking for something - I'm not a database person,  but something sort of standard enough that,	1
you know, if we start using this we can give it out, other people can work on it, or -  Is it - ?	1
Yeah, it's not standard. I mean, it's something that we developed at ICSI.	1
But it's  been used here and people've -	0
But it's been used here and - and, you know, we have a  well-configured system that you can distribute for free, and -	1
I mean, it must be the equivalent of whatever  you  guys used to store feat- your computed features in, right?	0
Yeah, th- we have -	0
Actually, we - we use a generalization of the - [MASK]	0
Yeah, so there is something like that but it's, um, probably not as sophist-	0
And I think there's -	0
Well, what does [MASK]  do for features? Or does it even  have  a concept of features?	0
They ha- it has its own -	0
I mean, [MASK] has their own feature format that's called, like, S_-	0
I'm just wondering, would it be worth while to use that  instead?	0
Yeah. Th- this is exactly the kind of decision - It's just whatever -	0
But, I mean, people don't typically  share   this  kind of stuff, right? I mean -	0
I just - you know, we - we've done this stuff on  [MASK]  and	0
three or four places have asked for [MASK]  and we just have an ASCII,	0
uh, output of frame-by-frame. Which is fine,	0
but it gets unwieldy to go in and - and query these files with really huge files.	0
I mean, we could  do  it. I was just thinking if there's something that - where  all  the frame values are - Hmm?	0
And a- and again, if you have a -	0
if you have a two-hour-long meeting, that's gonna -	0
They're - they're fair- they're quite large. And these are for ten-minute [MASK] and -	0
Yeah, I mean, they'd be emo- enormous.	0
So it's doable, it's just that you can only store a feature vector at frame-by-frame and it doesn't have any kind of,	0
Is - is the  sharing  part of this a pretty important  consideration or does that just sort of, uh - a nice thing to have?	0
I - I don't know enough about what we're gonna do with the data.  But I thought it would be good to get something that	1
we can - that other people can use or adopt for  their   own kinds of	1
encoding. And just,  I mean  we have to use some- we have to make  some  decision about what to do. And especially for the prosody work, what -	1
what it ends up being is you get	1
features from the signal, and of course those change every time your alignments change. So you re-run a recognizer, you want to recompute	1
your features, um, and then keep the database up to date. Or you change a word, or you change a	1
[MASK] which is gonna happen a lot.	1
And so I wanted something where  all of this can be done in a elegant way and that if somebody	1
wants to  try  something or compute something  else,  that it can be done flexibly.	1
Um, it doesn't have to be  pretty,  it just has to be,	1
you know, easy to use, and -	1
Yeah, the other thing -	0
We should look at [MASK]	1
and see if they have anything at that level. I mean, I'm not sure what to do about  this  with [MASK] because they chose a different route.	0
I chose something that - Th- there are sort of two choices. Your - your file format	1
know that you're talking about language  and speech, which is what  I  chose, and time,	1
or your file format can just be a graph representation.	1
And then the application has to impose the structure on top.	1
So what it looked like [MASK] chose is,  they  chose the  other  way, which was their file format is just	1
[MASK] and you have to interpret what they mean yourself.	1
And why did you not choose that type of approach?	0
Uh, because I knew that we were doing speech, and I thought it was  better	1
if you're looking at a raw file to be - t- for the tags to say "it's an utterance", as opposed to the tag to say "it's a link".	1
But other than that, are they compatible? I mean, you could sort of -	0
I mean, you - you could -	0
You could probably translate between  them.	0
Yeah, that's w- So, O_K.	0
So, well, the other thing  is	0
if we choose to use  ATLAS,  which maybe we should just  do,  we should just throw this  out  before we invest a lot of  time  in it.	0
So this is what the meeting's about, just sort of how to - Um, cuz we need to come up with a database like this just to do our work. And I actually don't	0
care, as long as it's something useful to other people, what we  choose.  So maybe it's -	0
maybe oth- you know, if - if you have any idea of how to choose, cuz I don't.	0
Do they already have  tools?	0
I mean, I - I  chose  this for a couple  reasons.  One of  them   is that it's easy to  parse.	1
You don't need a full X_M_L parser. It's very easy to just write a Perl script  to parse it.	0
As long as  uh  each tag is on one line.	0
Exactly. Exactly. Which I always do.	0
And you can have as much information in the tag as you want, right?	0
Well, I have it structured. Right? So each type tag has only particular items that it can take.	0
Can you - But you can add to those structures	1
If you have more information.   So what -	1
What  [MASK]  would say is that instead of doing  this,  you would say something like "link	1
start equals, um, you know, some node I_D, end equals some other node I_D",	1
and then [MASK]	1
You know, so it's very similar.	0
So why would it be a - a  waste  to  do  it this way if it's  similar  enough that we can always  translate  it?	0
It probably wouldn't be a  waste.  It would mean that at some point if we wanted to switch, we'd just have to	0
Write a translator. But it se-	0
But it - but that sounds -	0
Since they are developing a big -	0
But that's - I don't think that's a big deal.	0
As long as it is -	0
they're developing a big infrastructure. And so it seems to me that if -	1
if  we want to use that, we might as well go  directly  to what they're doing, rather than -	0
If we want to -	0
Do they already  have  something that's - that would be useful for us in place?	1
Yeah. See, that's the question. I mean, how stable is their -	0
Are they ready to go, or - ?	0
The - I looked at it - The last time I looked at it was a  while  ago, probably a  year  ago,	1
uh, when we first started talking about this. And at  that  time at least	0
it was still not very  complete.	0
And so, specifically they didn't have any external format representation at that time.	1
They just had the sort of conceptual  node -	1
uh, [MASK] which I really  liked.  And that's exactly what this stuff is based on.	1
Since  then, they've developed their own external file format,	1
which is, uh, you know, this sort of s-  this  sort of thing.	0
Um, and apparently they've also developed a lot of  tools,  but I haven't looked at them. Maybe I should.	1
@@  We should - we should find out.	0
I mean, would the tools - would the tools run on something like  this,  if you can translate them anyway?	0
Um, th- what would - would - would - what would  worry  me is that maybe we might miss a little detail	1
I mean, that - I guess it's a question that -  uh, yeah .	0
that would make it very difficult to translate from one to the other.	0
I - I think if it's conceptually  close,  and they already have or will have tools that everybody  else  will be using, I mean,	1
Yeah, we might as well.	0
it would be crazy to do something s- you know, separate that -	1
So I'll - I'll take a closer look at it.	1
Actually, so it's - that - that would really be the question, is just what you would feel is in the long run the best thing. Cuz	0
once we start, sort of, doing this I don't - we don't actually have enough time to probably have to rehash it out again and -	0
The other thing - the other way that I sort of established  this  was as easy translation to and from [MASK]	1
I mean, I  like  this. This is sort of intuitively easy to actually r- read, as easy it could - as it could be. But,	0
I suppose that  as long as they have a type here that specifies "utt",	0
It's  almost  the same. The - the - the - the  point  is - with  this,  though, is that you can't really add any supplementary information.	1
it's - yeah, close enough that -	0
Right? So if you suddenly decide that you want -	0
You have to make a different type.	1
Yeah. You'd have to make a different type.	0
So - Well, if you look at it and -	0
Um, I guess in my mind I don't know enough - Jane would know better,  about	0
the   types  of  annotations  and - and -	0
But I imagine that those are things that would - well,  you  guys mentioned this,  that could span any -	0
it could be in its own channel, it could [MASK] it could be instantaneous, things like that. Um,	0
and then from the  recognition  side we have	0
[MASK] If - if it can handle  that,  it could handle states or whatever.	0
And then [MASK]  we have	0
frame - sort of like [MASK]	0
And then we have the aligned channels, of course, and -	0
It seems to me you want to keep the frame-level stuff separate.	1
Yeah. I - I definitely agree and I wanted to find actually a f- a nicer format or a - maybe a more compact format than what we used before. Just cuz you've got	0
ten channels or whatever and two hours of a meeting. It's - it's a lot of -	0
Now - now how would you -	1
how would you represent, um, multiple speakers in this framework? Were - You would just represent them as -	1
You would have like a speaker tag or something?	0
there's a spea- speaker tag up at the top which identifies them and then each utt-	1
the way I had it is each turn or each utterance,  I don't even remember now, had a speaker I_D tag attached to it.	1
And in  this  format you would have a different  tag,	0
which - which would, uh, be linked to the link.	0
So - so somewhere else you would have another thing  that would be, um -	0
Let's see, would it be a node or a link? Um -	0
And so - so this one would have, um, an I_D is link -	0
[MASK] or something like that. And then somewhere up here you would have a link that - that, uh,	0
you know, was referencing [MASK] and had speaker Adam.	0
Actually, it's the  channel,  I think, that -	0
You know, or something like that.	0
I mean, w- yeah, channel is what [MASK] out-	0
Well, channel or speaker or whatever. It doesn't -	0
This  isn't quite right. I have to look at it again.	0
Right.  But - but - so how in the NIST format do we express	1
a hierarchical relationship between, um, say, an utterance and the words within it?	1
So how do you  tell  that  these are the words that belong to that utterance?	1
Um, you would have another structure lower down than this that would be saying they're all belonging to this I_D.	1
So each thing refers to the  utterance that it belongs to.	0
And then each utterance could refer to a turn, and each turn could refer to something higher up.	0
So it's - it's not hi- it's sort of bottom-up.	0
And what if you actually have -	0
So right now what  you  have as  utterance,  um, the closest thing that comes out of [MASK]  is the	0
stuff between [MASK] that the transcribers put in or that Thilo put in,	0
which may or may not actually be, like, a s- it's usually  not  - um, the beginning and end of a sentence, say.	0
Well, that's why I didn't call it "sentence".	0
So, right.  Um, so it's like a segment or something. So,	0
I mean, I assume this is possible, that if you have - someone annotates the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe,	0
you can say, you know, from -	0
for - from the c- beginning of the sentence to the end of the sentence, from the annotations, this is a unit, even though it  never  actually -	0
i- It's only a unit by virtue of [MASK]	0
Sure. I mean, so you would - you would have yet another tag.	0
And then that would get a tag somehow. O_K.	0
You'd have another tag which says this is of type "sentence".	0
But it's just not overtly in the -	0
Um, cuz this is exactly the kind of -	0
I think that should be   possible  as long as the -	0
But, uh, what I don't understand is where the - where in this type of file  that would be expressed.	0
Right. You would have another  tag  somewhere.	0
It's - well, there're  two  ways of doing it.	0
S- so it would just be floating before the sentence or floating after the sentence without a time-mark.	0
You could have some sort of link type -	0
And then lower down you could have an utterance. So the [MASK] -	0
[MASK] And you could either say that -	0
No. I don't know - I take that back.	0
So here's the thing. Um -	0
Can you - can you say that this is	0
You would just have a r-	0
part of this, or do you say this is part of this? I think -	0
You would refer up to the sentence.	0
they're actually overlapping each other, sort of.	0
the thing is that some- something may be a part of	0
one thing for one purpose and another thing of another purpose.	0
You have to have another type then, I guess.	0
Um, well,  s- let's - let's ta- so let's -	0
Well, I think I'm - I think w- I had better look at it again because I - I'm -	1

There's one level - there's one more level of indirection that I'm forgetting.	0
Suppose you have a word sequence and you have two different segmentations of that same word sequence. f- Say, one segmentation is in terms of,	1
you know, uh,  sentences.  And another segmentation is in terms of, um,  I don't know,  [MASK]	1
And let's say that they don't  nest. So, you know, [MASK] may cross	1
two sentences or something. I don't know if that's true or not but  let's as-	0
Well, it's definitely true with the segment. That's what I - exactly what I meant by the utterances versus the sentence could be sort of -	0
So, you want to be s- you want to say this - this  word  is part of that sentence and this prosodic phrase.	0
But the phrase is not part of the sentence and neither is the sentence part of the phrase.	0
I- I'm pretty sure that you can do that, but I'm forgetting the exact level of nesting.	1
So, you would have to have  two different pointers from the word up - one level up, one to the sent-	0
So - so what you would end up having is a tag saying "here's a word, and it starts here and it ends here".	0
And then lower down you would say "here's [MASK] and it has these words in it".	0
And lower down you'd have "here's a  sentence,  and it has these words in it".	0
So  you  would be able to go in and say, you know, "give me all the words in the bound- in the prosodic phrase and give me all the words in the -"  Yeah.	0
So I think that's - that would wor- Let me look at it again.	0
The - the o- the  other  issue that  you  had was, how do you actually efficiently extract, um -	0
find and extract information in a structure of this type?	0
So you gave some examples like -	0
Well, uh, and, I mean, you guys might -	0
I don't know if this is premature because I suppose once you get the representation you can  do  this, but the kinds of things I was worried about is,	0

Is the rising pitch a   feature,  or is it gonna be in the same file?	0
Well, the rising pitch will never be  hand-annotated. So the - all the prosodic features are going to be automatically - So they're gonna be in those -	0
I mean, that's gonna be hard regardless, right? Because you're gonna have to write a program that goes through your feature file and looks for rising pitches.	0
So - Right. So normally what we would do is we would say	0
"what do we wanna assign rising pitch to?" Are we gonna assign it to  words?  Are we gonna just assign it to sort of -	0
when it's rising we have [MASK] But suppose we dump out this file and we say,	0
uh, for every word we just classify it as, w- you know, rise or fall or neither?	0
O_K. Well, in that case you would add that to this  format r-	0
So we would basically be sort of, um,	1
taking the format and enriching it with things that we wanna	1
query in relation to the words that are already in the file, and then querying it. O_K.	1
You want sort of a grep that's - that works at the structural -	0
There's a  standard again in X_M_L, specifically for searching X_M_L documents - structured X_- X_M_L documents, where you can specify both the content and the structural position.	1
Yeah, but it's - it's not clear that that's -	0
That's relative to the structure of the X_M_L document, not to the structure of what you're  representing  in the document.	0
You use it as a tool.	0
You use it as a tool, not an end-user. It's not an end-user thing. It's - it's - you would use that to build your tool to do that sort of search.	1
Because  here  you're specifying a  lattice.  So the  underlying   -	0
that's the underlying data structure. And you want to be able to search in that lattice.	0
But as long as the -	0
It's a graph, but -	0
That's  different  from searching through the text.	0
But  it seems like as long as the features that -	0
Well, no, no, no. The whole  point  is that the text and the lattice are  isomorphic.	0
They  represent each other   completely.	0
That's true if [MASK] or whatever that are not explicitly  in  this are at the level of these types.	0
That - that if you can	0
Yeah, but that's gonna be the trouble no matter what.	0
Right? No matter what format you choose, you're gonna have the trou- you're gonna have the difficulty of relating	1
That's right. That's true. That's why I was trying to figure out what's the best format for this representation. And it's  still  gonna be -	0
the - the frame-level features -	1
it's still gonna be, uh, not direct. You know, it -	0
Or another example was, you know, uh, where in the language - where in the word sequence	0
I guess that one's actually easier.	0
What about - what about, um,	1
the idea of using a relational database to, uh, store the information from the X_M_L? So you would have - X_M_L basically would -	1
Uh, you - you could use the X_M_L to put the data  in,	0
and then when you get data out, you put it back in X_M_L. So use X_M_L as sort of the -	0
[MASK] uh, but then you store the data in the database, which	1
allows you to do all kinds of  good search things in there.	1
One of the things that ATLAS is doing is they're trying to define an A_P_I which is independent of [MASK]	1
so that, uh, you could define a single A_P_I and the - the storage could be flat X_M_L files or a database.	1
My  opinion on that is for the s- sort of stuff that we're doing,  I suspect it's overkill to do a full relational database, that, um,	1
just a flat file and, uh, search tools I  bet  will be enough.	1
But that's the advantage of ATLAS, is that if we actually take -	0
decide to go that route completely and we program to their A_P_I, then if we wanted to add a database later it would be pretty easy.	0
It seems like the kind of thing you'd do if - I don't know, if people start adding all kinds of s- bells and whistles to the data. And so that might be -	0
I mean, it'd be good for us to know - to use a format where	0
we know we can easily, um, input that to some database if other people are using it.	0
I guess I'm just a  little  hesitant to try to go whole hog on sort of the -	1
the whole framework that - that NIST is talking about, with ATLAS  and  a database and all that sort of stuff, cuz it's a big learning curve,	1
just to get going. Whereas if we  just  do a flat file format,	1
sure, it may not be as efficient but  everyone  can program in Perl and - and  use  it.	0
Right? So, as opposed to -	0
But this is - I - I'm still, um,	0
not convinced that you can do much at  all  on the text - on the flat file that - that - you know, the text representation.	0
Because the text representation is gonna be,	0
uh, not reflecting the structure of - of your words and annotations.	0
It's just - it's -	0
Well, if it's not  representing  it, then how do you  recover  it? Of  course  it's representing it. That's the whole  point.	0
No. You - you have to - what you have to do is you have to basically -	0
Y- yeah. You can use Perl to read it in and construct a internal representation that is essentially a lattice.	0
the - and then -	0
O_K. Well,  that  was a different  point.  Right? So what I was  saying	0
But  that's  what you'll have to  do.	0
For Perl - if you want to just do Perl. If you wanted to use the structured X_M_L query language, that's a different thing. And it's a set of tools  that let you specify given [MASK] of the document,	1
um, what sorts of structural searches you want to do.	0
So you want to say that, you know, you're looking for,	0
um, a tag within a tag within a particular tag that has this particular text in it,	0
um, and, uh, refers to a particular value.	0
And so the point isn't that an end-user, who is looking for a query like you specified, wouldn't program it in this language. What you would do is,	1
someone would build a  tool  that used that as a library.	1
So that they - so that you wouldn't have to construct the internal representations yourself.	0
See, I think the kinds of questions, at least in the next - to the end of this year, are -	0
there may be a lot of different ones, but they'll all have a similar nature. They'll be	0
looking at either [MASK]	0
uh, an - a  value,  like a continuous value, like the slope of something. But	0
you know, we'll do  something  where we -	0
some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o- uh, either [MASK] or at the	0
[MASK] or - or  something  like that. They're not gonna b	0
sort of giving them simpler shapes and things.	0
And so the main thing is just being able -	0
Well, I guess, the  two  goals. Um, one that  Chuck  mentioned is	1
starting out with something that we don't have to start over, that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions,	1
and  being able to at least get enough, uh, information out on -	1
where we condition the location of features on information that's in the kind of file that you  put up  there.	1
And that would - that would do it, I mean, for  me.	0
Yeah. I think that there are quick and dirty solutions, and then there are long-term, big-infrastructure solutions. And so	0
we want to try to pick something that lets us do a little bit of both.	0
In the between, right. And especially that the representation doesn't have to be thrown away, even if your tools change.	0
And so it seems to me that - I mean, I have to  look  at it again to see whether it can really do what we  want,	1
but if we use the ATLAS external file representation,	1
it  seems  like it's rich enough that you could do  quick  tools just as I said in Perl,	1
and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve, we can use the whole ATLAS inter- infrastructure,	1
I mean, that sounds good to me. I - I don't -	0
which has all that built in.	0
So if - if you would l- look at that and let us know what you think.  I mean,	0
I think we're sort of guinea pigs, cuz I - I want to get the prosody work  done  but I don't want to waste time, you know,	0
Well, I wouldn't wait for the formats, because anything you pick we'll be able to translate	0
Ma- well, maybe you should actually look at it yourself too to get a sense of	0
what it is you'll - you'll be dealing with, because,	0
you know, Adam might have  one  opinion but you might have  another,  so	0
I think the more eyes look at this the better.	0
Especially if there's,  e-  um - you know, if someone can help with at least the -	0
the setup of the right -	0
the right representation, then, i- you know, I hope it won't - We don't actually need the whole full-blown thing to be  ready,  so.	0
Can you - Oh, well.	0
Um, so maybe if you guys can look at it and sort of see what,	0
I think we're - we're -  we're actually just - yeah, wrapping up, but, um -	0
Yeah, sorry, it's a  uh  short meeting, but, um -	0
Well, I don't know. Is there anything else, like -	0
I mean  that helps  me  a lot, but -	0
Well, I think the  other  thing we  might  want to look at is alternatives to P_file. I mean, th- the reason I like P_file is I'm already familiar with it, we have expertise  here,	1
and so if we pick something else, there's the learning-curve problem. But, I mean, it is just something we developed at ICSI.	1
Is there an - is there an I_P- A_P_I?	0
Yeah. There's an A_P_I for it. And, uh,	1
There used to be a problem that they get too large,	0
a bunch of libraries, [MASK]	1
and so  basically the -  uh  the filesystem	0
Well, that's gonna be a problem no matter what. You have the two-gigabyte limit on the filesystem size.	0
And we definitely hit that with Broadcast News.	0
Maybe you could extend the A_P_I to, uh, support, uh, like splitting up,	0
you know, conceptually one file into smaller files on disk so that you can essentially,	0
you know, have arbitrarily long f-	0
Most of the tools can handle that. So that	0
we didn't do it at the A_P_I-level. We did it at the t- tool-level. That - that - most - many of them can s- you can specify several P_files and they'll just be done sequentially.	0
So, I guess, yeah, if - if you and Don can - if you can show him the P_file stuff and see. So this would be like for [MASK]	0
I mean, if you do [MASK]	0
I've  used  the P_file, I think. I've  looked  at it at least, briefly, I think when we were doing	0
What does the P_ stand for anyway?	0
I  didn't de- I didn't develop it. You know, it was - I  think  it was Dave Johnson.	0
So it's all part of the Quicknet library. It has all the utilities for it.	0
No,  P_files  were around  way  before  Quicknet.	0
P_files were - were around when - w- with, um,  RAP.	0
It's like the history of ICSI. Like -	0
You  worked with P_files.  I  worked with P_files.	0
I don't remember what the " P_ " is, though.	0
Is it related to [MASK]	0
But there are ni- they're -	0
The  Quicknet library has a bunch of things in it to handle P_files, so it works pretty well.	0
And that isn't really, I guess, as important as the - the main - I don't know what you call it, the -	0
the main sort of word-level -	0
O_K. Well, that's really useful. I mean, this is exactly the kind of thing that I wanted to settle. Um, so -	0
Yeah, I've been meaning to look at the ATLAS stuff again anyway. So, just keep -	0
I guess it's also sort of a political deci- I mean, if - if you feel like that's a community that would	0
be good to tie into  anyway,  then it's -	0
sounds like it's worth doing.	0
Yeah, I think it - it w-	0
j-  I think there's -	0
And, w- uh, as I said, I - what I did with  this  stuff - I  based  it on theirs. It's just they hadn't actually come up with an external format yet.	0
So now that they  have  come up with a format,	0
it doesn't - it seems pretty reasonable to use it.	0
But let me look at it again.	0
As I said, that -	0
Cuz we actually can start -	0
There's one level - there's one more level of indirection and I'm just blanking on exactly how it works.	0
I gotta look at it again.	0
I mean, we can  start  with, um, I guess, this input from Dave's, which you had printed out, [MASK] Cuz he has all of the	0
channels, you know, with [MASK] and stuff like that. So that would be  i-  directly,	0
Easy - easy to map.	0
Yeah. And so then it would just be a matter of getting -	0
making sure to handle the annotations that are, you know, not at the word-level and, um,	0
Where are those annotations coming from?	0
Well, right now, I g- Jane would -  would -	0
Are you talking about [MASK]	0
Yeah, any kind of annotation  that, like, isn't already there. Uh, you know, anything you can envision.	0
So what  I  was imagining was - um, so Dave says we can have unlimited numbers of green ribbons.	0
And so put, uh, a - a green ribbon on for [MASK]	0
And since we w- we - I - I think it's important to remain flexible regarding [MASK] for now.	0
And so it's nice to have -	0
However, you know, you want to have it, uh, time- time- uh,  located  in the discourse. So, um,	0
if we - if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap,	1
then you'll have a time-marking. It won't - it'll be independent of the time bins,	1
however these e- evolve, shrink, or whatever, increase, or - Also, you could have different time bins for different purposes.	1
And having it tied to the first word in [MASK] is unique, uh, you know, anchored, clear.	0
And it would just end up on a separate ribbon.	0
So [MASK] is gonna be  easy  with respect to that.	0
I - I just - I don't quite understand what these things are.  Uh.	0
O_K. What, the codes themselves? Or the - ?	0
Well, th- overlap codes. I'm not sure what that  @@  -	0
Well, I mean, is that -	0
Well, we don't have to go into the codes. We don't have to go into the codes. But let me just -	0
It probably doesn't matter. No, I d-	0
I mean, it doesn't. I mean, that - not for the topic of  this  meeting.	0
No. W- the idea is just to have a separate green ribbon,	0
you know, and - and - and let's say that this is [MASK] There's a word here. This is the first word of an overlapping segment of  any   length,	0
overlapping with  any  other, uh, word - uh, i- segment of any length. And, um,	0
then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a ch- [MASK]	0
or you can say that it was, um, [MASK] or you can - you know, any - any number of categories. But the fact is, you have it  time-tagged	0
in a way that's independent of the, uh, sp- particular time bin that the word ends up in.	0
If it's a large unit or a small unit, or we sh- change the boundaries of the units,	0
it's still unique and - and, uh, fits with the format,	0
it would be nice - um,	0
eh, gr- this is sort of r- regarding -	0
uh, uh  it's related but not directly germane to the topic of discussion, but, when it comes to annotations, um,	1
you often find yourself in the situation where you have  different annotations  of the same, say, word sequence.	1
O_K? And sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited s- at one place but not the other.	1
So, once this data gets out there, some people might start annotating this for,	0
I don't know, dialogue acts or, um,	0
you know, topics or what the heck. You know, there's a zillion things that people might annotate this for.	0
And the only thing that	0
is really sort of common among all the versi- the various versions of this data is the word sequence,	0
Or the times. But, see, if you'd annotate dialogue acts, you don't necessarily want to - or topics - you don't really want to be dealing with  time-marks.	1
You'd - it's much more efficient for them to just see the  word  sequence, right?	0
I mean, most people aren't as  sophisticated  as - as we are  here  with, you know, uh, [MASK] and stuff. So -	0
So the - the - the  point  is -	0
Should - should we mention some names on the people who are n- ?	0
So, um, the p- my  point  is that  you're gonna end up with,	0
uh, word sequences that are differently annotated. And  you want some tool,	1
uh, that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single,	1
Um, and we had this problem very massively, uh, [MASK] when we worked, uh, a while back on,	0
well, on dialogue acts as well as, uh, you know, um, what  was  it?  uh,	0
Well, [MASK] in it. Yeah.	0
utterance types. There's, uh, automatic, uh, punctuation and stuff like that.	0
Because we had one set of  annotations that were based on,	0
uh, one version of the transcripts with a particular segmentation, and then we had  another  version that was based on,	0
uh, a different s- slightly  edited  version of the transcripts with a  different  segmentation. So,	0
we had these two different	0
versions which were - you know, you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical. So it was extremely hard	0
to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations.	0
Yep. I - I don't see any way that  file  formats are gonna  help  us with that. It's - it's all a question of semantic.	1
No. But once you have a file format, I can imagine writing -	1
not personally, but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool,	1
um, that mediates between various versions, and -	1
uh, sort of like th- uh, you know, you have this thing in UNIX where you have, uh,	0
There's the, uh, diff that actually tries to reconcile different -	0
two diffs f-  based on the same original.	0
um, but operating on these lattices that are really what's behind this - uh, this annotation format.	0
You could definitely do that with the -	0
There's actually a diff library you can use  to do things like that that -	0
So somewhere in the A_P_I you would like to have like a merge or some - some function that merges two -	0
so you have different formats.	0
Yeah, I think it's gonna be very hard. Any sort of structured	0
anything  when you try to merge is really, really hard because you ha- i-	1
The hard part isn't the file format. The hard part is specifying what you  mean  by "merge".	1
But the one thing that would work here actually for i- that is more reliable than the utterances is the -	0
the speaker ons and offs. So if you have a good, um -	0
But this is exactly what I  mean,  is that - that the problem i-	0
You just have to know wha- what to tie it to.	0
Yeah, exactly. The problem is saying "what are the semantics, what do you  mean  by "merge"?" So.	0
So - so just to let you know what we - where we  kluged  it by, uh, doing -	0
uh, by doing - Hhh.	0
Both were based on  words,  so, bo- we have two versions of the same words intersp- you know, sprinkled with - with different  tags  for annotations.	0
And then you did diff.  Yeah, that's just what I thought.	0
And we did  diff.  Exactly!	0
And that's how - Yeah.	0
That's just wh- how  I  would have done it.	0
But, you know, it had lots of errors and things would end up in the wrong order, and so forth. Uh, so,	0
um, if you had a more -	0
Uh, it - it was a kluge because it was basically [MASK]	0
But, d- isn't that something where whoever - if  - if the people	0
who are making changes, say in the transcripts, cuz this all happened when the transcripts were different -	0
ye- um, if they  tie  it to  something,  like if they tied it to [MASK] - if they -	0
You know what I mean? Then - Or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the  time-marks,  that would help. But the problem is exactly as Adam said, that you get,	0
you know, y- you don't  have  that information or it's lost in the merge somehow, so -	0
Well, can I ask one question? It - it seems to me that, um, we will have o- an official version of the corpus, which will be only one -	0
one version in terms of the words - where the words are concerned.	0
We'd still have the - the merging issue maybe if coding were done independently of the -	0
And you're gonna  get  that because if the data gets out, people will do all kinds of things to it.	0
And, uh, s- you know, several years from now you might want to look into, um,	0
[MASK] And someone at the university of who knows where has ann	0
So you want to get that annotation and bring it back in line with your data.	0
But unfortunately they've also hand-edited it.	0
But they've also - Exactly. And so that's exactly what we should - somehow when you distribute the data, say that - you know,	0
that - have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that.	0
What's - what's wrong with  doing times? I -	0
I agree. That was what I was wondering.	0
Uh, yeah, time is the -  Time is passing!	0
Time is unique. You were saying that you didn't think we should - Andreas was saying - Yeah.	0
Time - time - times are	0
what if they haven't notated with them, times?	0
He - he's a language modeling person, though.	0
So - so imagine - I think his - his example is a good one. Imagine that this person who developed the corpus of the referring expressions didn't include time.	0
He included references to  words.  He said that at this  word  is when - when it happened. Or she.	0
But then couldn't you just indirectly figure out the time  tied to the  word?	0
Sure. But what if - what if they change the  words?	0
Not - Well, but you'd have  some  anchoring point. He couldn't have changed  all  the words.	0
But can they change the words without changing the  time  of the word?	0
Sure. But they could have changed it a little.	0
The - the  point  is, that - that they may have annotated it off a  word  transcript that isn't the same as  our  word transcript, so how do you merge it back in? I understand what you're saying.	0
And I - I guess the  answer  is,	0
um, it's gonna be  different  every  time.	0
It's j- it's just gonna be -	0
You only know the boundaries of the -	0
I- it's  exactly  what I said before, which is that "what do you mean by "merge"?"	0
So in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times, well, what do you  mean  by "merge"?	0
If you tell me what you  mean,  I can write a program to  do  it.	0
Right. You can merge at the level of the representation that the other person preserved and that's it.	0
Right. And that's about all you can do.	0
And beyond that, all you know is - is relative ordering and sometimes even that is wrong.	0
So - so in - so in this one you would have to do a best match between the word sequences,	0
extract the times f- from the best match of theirs to yours, and use that.	0
And then infer that [MASK] are somewhere in between. Yeah, exactly.	0
But it could be that they just - uh, I mean, it could be that they chunked - they - they lost certain utterances and all that stuff, or -	0
Right, exactly. So it could get very, very ugly.	0
Alright. Well, I guess, w- I - I didn't want to keep people  too  long and Adam wanted t- people -  I'll  read the digits. If anyone else offers to, that'd be great. And	0
Ah, well.  For th- for the -  for the benefit of science we'll read the digits.	0
if not, I guess -	0
More digits, the better. O_K, this is	0
Thanks - thanks a lot.  It's really helpful. I mean, Adam and Don  will sort of meet and I think that's great. Very useful.	0
