We didn't have a house before.	0
Yeah, so if  uh -	0
So if anyone  hasn't  signed the consent form,	0
The new and improved consent form.	0
Now you won't be able to  walk  or ride your  bike,  huh?	0
And uh, shall I go ahead and do some digits?	0
Uh, we were gonna do that at the  end,  remember?	0
Just - just to be consistent, from here on in at least, that -	0
that we'll do it at the end.	0
Well, it ju- I mean it might be that someone here has to go, and -  Right? That was - that was sort of the point.	0
I had asked actually anybody who had any ideas for an agenda	0
to send it to me and no one did. So,	0
From  last  time I wanted to - Uh	0
The - An iss- uh	0
one topic from last time.	0
O_K, so one item for an agenda is uh  Jane has some uh	0
uh some research to talk about,	0
And I have some   short  research issues.	0
Uh, Adam has some short research issues.	0
list of things that I think were  done  over the last three months I was supposed to	0
and, um  I - I sent a note about it to uh - to Adam and Jane but I think I'll just run through it	0
also and see if someone thinks it's inaccurate or	0
A list that you have to send off to  who?	0
Uh, to uh uh, I_B_M.	0
O_K.   They're, you know -	0
So, uh  so, I'll go through that.	0
anyone wants to talk about?	0
What about the, um - your  trip,  yesterday?	0
Sort of off-topic I guess. Cuz that's  Cuz that was all - all about the, uh -	0
I - I - I can chat with you about that  off-line. That's another thing.	0
Uh, there's a - I mean, there is a -  a, um	0
which will be a conference call  that some of us are involved in	0
for uh a possible proposal.	0
Um, we'll talk - we'll talk about it next week if - if something -	0
Do you want me to  be there for that?	0
I noticed you C_ C'ed  me, but I wasn't actually a recipient.	0
I didn't quite know what to make of that.	0
Uh Well, we'll talk - talk about that after our meeting.	0
Uh, O_K. So it sounds like the - the three main things that we have to talk about are, uh this list, uh Jane and - Jane and Adam have some research items, and, other than that, anything,	0
O_K, uh, Jane, since - since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours, make sure we get to it.	0
O_K, it's - it's very	0
eh - it's  very brief, I mean - just let me - just hand these out. Oops.	0
Is this the same as the email or different?	0
It's slightly different. I -	0
But, same idea. So, if you've looked at this you've seen it before, so  Basically,  um	1
includes a mark that indicates  an overlap.	1
with, um  uh, tight  precision,  it's just indicated that -	1
It's indicated to - to - so the people know	1
which - which stretches of speech were in the  clear,	1
versus being overlapped by others. So, I	1
used this mark and, um	0
which divides things into individual minutes,	0
of which we ended up with forty  five, and a little bit.	0
you know, minute zero, of course, is the first minute up to	0
What you can see is the number of overlaps	1
whether they involve  two  speakers,  three  speakers, or  more  than three speakers.	1
what I was looking for sp- sp- specifically  was  the question of	1
whether they're distributed  evenly  throughout or whether they're	1
And  it looked to me as though -	0
uh, you know - y- this is just -	1
eh - eh, this would - this is  not  statistically	1
did  look to me as though there are bursts  throughout,  rather than being	1
localized to a particular region.	1
The  part  down there, where there's the  maximum  number of -	1
of, um  overlaps is an area where we were discussing	1
whether or not it would be useful to indi- to s- to	1
as possible indication of, uh   information  retrieval.	1
What was - what's the - the  parenthesized  stuff  that says, like -	0
e-  the first one that says  six  overlaps and then  two  point eight?	0
So,  six  is, uh  two point eight percent  of the total number of overlaps in the  session.	0
this is when people were,	0
you know, packing up to go basically, there's	0
this  final  stuff, I think we -	0
I don't remember  where  the digits  fell. I'd have to look at that. But	0
the final three there are no overlaps at all.	0
And  couple times there  are not. So, i- it seems like it goes through bursts	0
but, um  that's kind of it. Now,	1
is there - are there	1
individual differences in whether you're likely to  be  overlapped  with  or to overlap with  others.	1
And, again  I want to emphasize this is just one  particular	0
one particular meeting, and also there's been no statistical  testing  of it all, but	0
I took the coding of	0
the - I, you know, my - I had this script	1
was the first speaker, who was the second speaker involved in a two-person overlap, I didn't look at the ones involving three or more.	1
this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of	0
who tended to be overlapping most often with who -	0
if you look at the  marginal  totals, which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom, you get	0
the totals for an  individual.  So,	0
look at the  bottom,  those are the, um	0
numbers of overlaps in which	0
um  Adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look -	0
I'm sorry, but you're o- alphabetical, that's why I'm choosing you	0
And then if you look across the  right,	0
then  that's where he was the	0
person who was the sp- first  speaker  in the pair	0
And,  then if you look down in the  summary  table,	1
then you see that, um	1
whether a person got overlapped  with  or	1
Is this uh  just raw  counts  or is it -	0
So it would be interesting to see	0
how much each person  spoke.	0
very  true - very true  it would be good to normalize with respect to that. Now on the table I did	0
Normalized to how much -	0
take one step toward, uh   away  from the [MASK] by putting,	0
uh   percentages.  So that the percentage of time	0
of the - of the times that a person spoke,	0
Of the times a person spoke  and  furthermore was involved in a two- two-person overlap,	1
what percentage of the time were they the  overlapper  and what percent of the time were they th- the  overlappee?	1
And  there,  it looks like you see some  differences,	0
that some people tend to be overlapped	1
with  more often than they're  overlapped,  but, of course,	1
uh i- e-  this is just  one  meeting,	1
uh  there's  no  statistical testing involved, and that would be	1
required for a - for a  finding   of  any  kind of	1
S- so, i- it would be  statistically  incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something.	0
No - no actually, that would be  actually  statistically  correct,  but	0
That's right. And I'm  you know, I'm - I don't see a point of singling people out,	0
now,  this  is a case where obviously -	0
B- I - I -  I  rather  enjoyed  it, but - but  this	0
But the numbers speak for themselves.	0
He's - Yeah, yeah, yeah.	0
Well,  you know, it's like - I'm not - I'm not	0
Yes, that's right, so you don't nee-  O_K.	0
saying on the tape who did	0
better or worse because  I don't think that it's - I	0
you know, and - and th- here's a case where of course, human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results,  and - and, so, might as well do this.	0
Yeah, when - this is what -	0
This is actually - when Jane sent this email  first,  is what caused me to start  thinking  about	0
Well, fair enough.  Fair enough.	0
And actually,  you know, the point is  not  about an individual, it's the point about  tendencies toward	1
you know, different  styles,  different speaker styles.	1
And  it would be, you know  of course,	1
there's also the question of what type of overlap	1
was  this, and w- what were they, and	1
i- and I - and I  know  that I can distinguish at least three types and, probably more, I mean, the	1
cultural idea which w- uh, the  conversation  analysts originally started with in the  seventies  was that we have this  strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th- before you start talking, and	0
and you know, I mean,	0
w- we know that -	0
an- and they've loosened up on that too s- in the intervening time, that	0
a culturally- relative  thing, I mean,  that you have the high-involvement style from the East  Coast  where people	0
will overlap  often  as an indication of  interest  in what the other person is  saying.	0
Yeah,  exactly!  Well, there you go. Fine, that's alright, that's O_K.	0
you know, in contrast, so Deborah - d- and also Deborah Tannen's  thesis she talked about differences of these types,  that they're just different  styles,  and it's um	0
you - you can't  impose  a model of -	0
there - of the ideal being no overlaps, and	0
you know, conversational analysts  also  agree with that, so it's	0
And - and, als- I mean,	0
but anyway, the people who used to say it was strict,	0
don't.  I mean they - they   also	0
ack- acknowledge the influence of	0
sub- of subcultural norms and	0
though - so - just - just superficially to give	1
um  a couple ideas of the  types  of overlaps involved, I have at the bottom several that  I  noticed. So,	1
uh, there are backchannels, like what Adam just did now and, um	1
um, anticipating the end of a  question	1
and  simply answering it earlier, and there are several of those in this - in these data where -	1
people who've talked to each other,	0
basically what the topic is, what the possibilities are and w- and we've spoken with each other so we know basically what the other person's  style  is likely to be and so	0
and t- there are a number of places where someone just answered  early.	0
which I thought were interesting, where two or  more  people gave exactly th- the same answer in unison - different words of course but you know, the - basically,	1
everyone's saying "yes" or - you know, or	0
ev- even more sp-  specific  than that.	0
So, uh, the point is that, um	1
overlap's not necessarily a bad  thing  and that it would be im-	1
i- useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved.	1
And that's all I wanted to say on that,	0
Well, of course th- the biggest,  um	1
result here, which is one we've -	1
we've talked about many times and isn't  new  to us, but which I think would be interesting to show someone who  isn't  familiar with this	1
is just the sheer number of  overlaps.	1
here's a relatively short meeting, it's a forty -	1
meeting, and  not  only were there two hundred and fifteen  overlaps	1
I think there's one -	1
one minute there where there - where - where there wasn't any overlap? I mean, it's -	1
Well, at the bottom, you have the bottom three.	0
So four - four minutes all together with  none   - none.	0
Oh, so the bottom three  did  have s- stuff going on?	0
Yes, uh-huh. Yeah. But just no overlaps.	0
O_K, so  if - the - this  -	0
It'd be  interesting  to see what the total amount of  time  is in the overlaps,	1
Yes, exactly and that's - that's where Jose's  pro-   project comes in.	0
I was about to ask -	0
I h- I have this- that infor- I have th- that information	0
Oh, about how much  is  it?	0
The - the  duration  of eh - of each of the overlaps.	0
O- oh, what's - what's the - what's the average	0
M- I - I haven't averaged it now but, uh  I - I will, uh	1
I will do the - the study of the -  with the - with the program with the - uh, the different, uh  the, nnn,  distribution of the duration of the overlaps.	1
O_K, you - you don- you don't have a feeling for roughly how  much it is? Yeah.	0
mmm,  Because the - the uh,  @@  is  @@ .	0
The duration is, uh  the variation - the variation of the duration is uh, very big	1
I suspect that it will also differ,	0
depending on the  type  of overlap  involved.  So backchannels will be very brief and -	0
Because, on your  surface  eh  a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration	0
eh,  overlapped  and another very very short.	0
Uh, i- probably it's very difficult to - to - because the - the overlap is, uh on- is only the - in the final "S_"	0
of the - of the - the fin- the - the end - the end word of the, um  previous speaker	0
with the - the next word of the - the new speaker.	0
Um, I considered  that's an overlap but it's very short, it's an "X_" with a -	0
and - the idea is probably, eh  when eh - when eh, we studied th- th- that zone, eh	0
eh, we h- we have eh eh  confusion with eh eh noise.	0
With eh  that  [MASK] but uh  I have  new  information but I have to - to  study .	0
Yeah, but I - I'd -	0
You split this by minute, um  so if an overlap	0
straddles  the boundary between two minutes, that counts towards  both  of those minutes.	0
Uh, so  le- let's think about the case where	1
and then B_ overlaps with A_,	1
and then the minute boundary happens.	1
um  B_ is still speaking,	1
that would be a new overlap.	1
comes to the conclusion of - of that turn without	1
anyone overlapping with him or her,	1
in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute.	1
No, but suppose they both	0
both a - a  portion  of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two.	0
O_K. In that case, um	0
the coding that I was using -	0
since we haven't,  uh  incorporated Adam's, uh  coding of overlap  yets,   the coding of	0
Yeah, "yets" is not a word.	0
since we haven't incorporated Adam's method of handling overl- overlaps yet	0
um  then  that would have fallen through the cra- cracks. It would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because, um  I wou- I wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was	0
We just haven't done th- the precise second to sec- you know,	1
second to second coding of  when  they occur.	1
I'm - I'm - I'm confused now. So l- l- let me restate what I  thought  Andreas was saying and - and see.	0
Let's say that in - in second fifty-seven	0
you start talking and I start talking	0
and  we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds.	0
So we go over - So we were - we were  talking  over one another,	0
in  each  case, it's just sort of one  interval.	0
So, um  we talked  over  the minute boundary.	1
Is this  considered as one overlap in each of the minutes, the way you have  done  this.	1
It would be considered as an overlap in the  first  one.	1
good,  i- I think, in the sense that I think Andreas  meant  the question, right?	0
That's -  that's good, yeah, cuz the overall rate is -	0
Mm-hmm. Yeah. They're  not  double  counted.	0
Other- otherwise you'd get  double  counts, here and there.	1
And then it would be  harder  -	0
I should also say I did a simplifying, uh  count in that	0
B_ overlapped with A_ and then A_ came  back  again and overlapped with  B_  again,	0
I - I didn't count that as a  three-person  overlap, I counted that as a  two-person  overlap,	0
and it was  A_  being overlapped with by  D_ .	0
Because the idea was the  first  speaker	0
started speaking and then the f- the first person reasserted the floor  kind of thing.	0
These are simplifying assumptions, didn't happen very often, there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing.	0
I want to go back and listen to minute forty-one.	0
Cuz i- i- I find it  interesting  that there were a large number of  overlaps  and they were  all   two-speaker.	1
I mean what I  thought  - what I	0
is that when there were a  large  number of  overlaps,  it was because  everyone  was talking at  once,	0
apparently  not.  That's really  neat.	0
Yeah, there's a lot of backchannel, a lot o- a lot of -	0
This  is  really interesting data.	0
Yeah, it  is.  I think so too, I think -	0
I  think  what's really interesting though, it is	0
saying " yes,  meetings have a lot of  overlaps " is to actually	0
find out  how  many  more	0
Cuz in  two-party  conversations, like  Switchboard,  there's an  awful  lot too if you just look at	0
backchannels,  if you consider those overlaps?	0
it's also ver- it's huge.	0
It's just that people haven't been	0
looking  at that because they've been doing  [MASK] for	0
So, the question is, you know, how many more overlaps	1
of, say the  two-person  type, by adding more  people.	1
and it  may  be a lot more but i- it may -	0
Well, but see, I find it interesting even if it  wasn't  any more,	0
since we  were  dealing with this[MASK] of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated  out	0
we just - everything was just  nice,  so that - so the issue is in - in a situation	0
Well, it's  not  really  " nice ".	0
It depends what you're  doing.	0
So if you were actually	0
Right now we're do- we have  individual   mikes on the people in this meeting.	0
So the question is, you know -	0
"are there really more overlaps  happening	0
than there would be in a  two-person    party ".	0
And - and there well may  be,  but -	0
let me rephrase what I'm saying	0
cuz I don't think I'm getting it across.	0
what I - what -	0
I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that's too - i- too imprecise.	0
But what I  mean  is	1
despite the many -  many  other problems that we have, one problem that we're  not  considering is overlap.	1
And what we're doing  now  is,	1
aside from the many  other  differences in the  task,  we  are  considering overlap	1
and  one  of the reasons that we're  considering  it,	1
you know,  one  of them	1
not  all  of them,  one  of them  is	1
that w- uh at least,	1
you know  I'm  very interested in	1
the scenario in which, uh	1
both people talking are pretty much equally   audible,	1
and from a single  microphone.	1
in that case, it  does  get mixed in,	1
and it's pretty hard to jus-	1
to just  ignore  it, to just do processing on  one  and not on the  other.	1
I - I agree that it's an issue here	1
but it's  also  an issue for  Switchboard  and if you	1
being recorded over the telephone, which I think,	0
you know, this  whole   point  of  studying   meetings  isn't just to have people in a  room  but to also have	0
meetings  over different  phone  lines.	0
Maybe far field  mike  people wouldn't be interested in that but all the  dialogue  issues still apply,	0
so if each of us was calling and having	0
you kn- you know like a  conference  call.	0
And, just the question is,	0
y- you know, in  Switchboard	0
you would  think  that's the  simplest   case  of a  meeting	0
of more than one person, and	0
I'm  wondering  how much more  overlap	0
the types that - that Jane  described  happen with more  people  present.	1
So it may be that having  three  people	1
is  very  different from having two people or it may  not  be.	1
That's an  important  question to ask. I think what I'm -	0
All I'm s- really saying is that I don't think we were  considering  that in Switchboard.	0
Though it wasn't   in  the  design.	0
Were you - were you - were you - were you measuring it?	0
I mean, w- w- were -	0
to tell you the truth, the reason why it's hard to measure is because	0
so, from the point of view of studying  dialogue,  I mean, which  Dan Jurafsky and Andreas and I had some projects on,	1
you want to know the  sequence  of turns.	1
So what happens is if  you're  talking and I have a backchannel in the middle of your turn,	1
and then you keep going	1
what it  looks  like in a dialogue model is  your  turn and then my  backchannel,	1
even though my backchannel occurred completely  inside  your turn.	1
So, for things like [MASK]	1
We  know  that that's  wrong	1
the  acoustic   segmentations  that were done and the fact that  some  of the acoustic data in  Switchboard  were  missing,	1
but that doesn't mean in the real  world  that people don't  talk  that way.	1
Yeah, I wasn't  saying  that.	0
Right? I was just saying that w-  now  we're  looking  at it.	0
And - and - and, you - you maybe  wanted  to look at it before but, for these various technical reasons in terms of how the  data  was you  weren't.	0
Right. We're  looking  at it  here.	0
So that's why it's coming to us as  new	0
even though it may well  be	0
you know, if your - if your hypothes- The hypothesis you were offering	0
if it's the  null  poth-  hypothesis,	0
and if actually you have as  much  overlap in a two-person,	0
we  don't  know the  answer  to that.	0
The reason we  don't  know the  answer  to is cuz it wasn't  studied	0
and it wasn't  studied  because it wasn't set  up.   Right?	0
Yeah, all I meant is	0
if you're asking the question from the point of view of	0
what's different about a  meeting,	0
studying  meetings  of, say, more than two  people  versus	0
kinds of questions you could ask with a  two-person   meeting.	0
that, you know, this project	1
is getting a lot of overlap	1
but  other  projects were too,	1
but we just couldn't  study  them.	1
We do kn- we don't know the numbers.	0
there  is  a high  rate,	0
It's - but I don't know  how  high,	0
See, I mean, i- i- le- let me t-	0
I mean, my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody, " what  have we learned about  overlaps  here?"	0
just never mind comparison with something else,	1
what we've learned about is  overlaps  in this situation, is that - the first -	1
the  first-order  thing I would say is that there's a  lot  of them.	1
In - in the sense that i- if you said	0
if - i- i- i-	0
I - I don't di-	0
In a way, I guess what I'm comparing to is more the	0
how - how much people  overlap.	0
Uh  you know the fact that when - when - when, uh, Adam was looking for a stretch of - of speech before, that didn't have any overlaps, and he w- he was having such a hard time	0
and now I look at  this  and I go, "well, I can  see  why he was having such a hard time". It's  happening  a  lot.	0
That's also true of  Switchboard.	0
It may not be -	0
I wasn't saying it  wasn't.	0
I was commenting about  this.	0
I'm saying if  I  -	0
All I'm saying is that from the	0
I'm saying if I  have  this complicated thing in  front  of me,	0
and we sh- which,  you know we're gonna get	0
much  more sophisticated about when we get  lots  more  data,	0
But - Then, if I was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn	0
right here, about, you know, the - the modest amount of data that was  analyzed  I'd say, "Well, the  first-order   thing  was there was a  lot  of  overlaps ".	1
and it's  not  just an overlap -	1
bunch of overlaps -  second-order  thing is	1
it's  not  just a bunch of overlaps in  one  particular  point,	1
but that there's overlaps, uh  throughout  the thing.	1
And that's  interesting.    That's  all.	0
No, I - I agree with that.	0
saying that it may -	0
the  reason  you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the  number  of people in the meeting.	0
Yeah, I wasn't making any  statement  about  that.	0
And - and it would actually be interesting to find  out  because	0
data say Switchboard, which isn't exactly the same kind of context, I mean these are two people who  don't  know each other and so forth,	0
But we should  still  be able to	1
say what - what is the  added   contra- contribution to sort of overlap	1
of each additional person, or something like that.	1
Yep. I could  certainly   see  it going  either   way.	0
Yeah, that would be good to know, but w- we -	0
Wh- yeah, I - I agree - I agree with Adam. And the reason is because I think there's a limit -	0
on how many you can have,  simply	0
from the standpoint of  audibility.  When we  speak  we - we  do  make a judgment of	0
you know, as  adults.   I mean, children don't  adjust  so well,	1
I mean, if a truck	1
well, depending, but  mostly,  adults will - will -	1
will hold off to what -	1
to finish the end of the sentence till the - till the  noise  is past. And I think we generally  do	1
about - whether we - whether our utterance will be in the clear or not.	1
And partly it's related to  rhythmic  structure in conversation, so,	1
you know, you - you t-	0
Yeah, this is d- also um,	0
people  tend  to  time  their - their -	0
when they  come into the conversation based on the overall rhythmic,  uh	0
So you  don't  want to be c- [MASK]	0
and, just to finish this,	1
there may be an upper bound on  how  many overlaps you can have,  simply  from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already	1
But I - you know,	0
Now if it's just  backchannels,	1
with less   intention  of being heard,	1
just sort of spontaneously doing  backchannels,	1
that -  those  might -	1
there may be  no  upper bound on  those.	1
I - I have a  feeling  that backchannels, which are	0
the vast majority of overlaps in  Switchboard,	0
uh, don't play as big a role  here,  because it's very  unnatural	0
I think, to backchannel if - in a multi-audience -	0
you know, in a multi-person	0
If you can  see  them, actually.	0
It's interesting, so if you watch people are going like -	0
Right  - right, like this  here,  but	0
That may not be the case if you couldn't see them.	0
but, it's sort of odd if one person's speaking and everybody's listening, and	0
it's unusual to have everybody going "uh-huh, uh-huh"	0
Actually,  I  think I've done it	0
a  fair  number of times today.  @@  But.	0
There's a lot of  head-nodding,	0
Yep, we need to put  trackers  on it.	0
In - in the  two-person  -	0
Plus - plus - plus the -	0
Yeah. So - so actually, um	1
That's in part because the  nodding,  if you have  visual  contact,	1
the nodding has the same  function,  but on the  phone,  in  Switchboard	1
you - you - that wouldn't  work.  So	0
Yeah, you don't have it.	0
so you  need  to use the  backchannel.	0
So, in the  two-person  conversations,	0
is there a great deal of	0
That  is  an earphone, so if you just put it  so it's on your ear.	0
in the speech? or -	0
Cuz my  impression  is sometimes	0
it happens when there's a  pause,	0
you know, like you - you	0
get a lot of backchannel, when somebody's  pausing	0
Sorry, what were you saying?	0
It's  hard  to do both, huh?	0
no, when - when - when there's  backchannel,  I mean, just -	1
I was just  listening,  and -	1
and when there's  two  people talking and there's  backchannel  it seems like,	1
um the  backchannel   happens  when, you know, the  pitch  drops and the first person -	1
and a  lot  of times, the first person actually  stops  talking and then there's a backchannel	0
and then they start  up  again, and so I'm wondering about -	0
I just wonder how much overlap there is.	0
I  think  there's a  lot  of the kind that  Jose  was talking about, where -	1
I mean, this is called "precision timing" in  conversation analysis,	1
but at a point where	1
So all you're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words.	1
So  technically,  it's an overlap.	1
But maybe a - just a  small  overlap?	0
you know, from  information  flow point of view it's not an overlap in  the predictable information.	1
It'd be  interesting  if we could do  prediction.	0
I was just thinking more in terms of  alignment,	0
Language  model prediction of  overlap,  that would be  really   interesting.	1
Well, that's  exactly,   exactly   why  we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins- in	1
uh  Switchboard,  say, because there's a lot of that.	1
So - so  here's  a - here's a first interesting   labeling  task.	1
Uh, to distinguish between, say,  backchannels	1
precision timing - Sort of	1
Let's pick a different word.	0
and sort of, um  I don't know,  hostile  overlaps, where	1
someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else.	1
Uh,  that  - that might be an  interesting,  um   problem  to  look  at.	0
Well, I mean you could do that. I ju- I - I think that	0
in this meeting I  really  had the feeling that wasn't happening, that	0
the hostile - hostile type.	0
These were - these were	1
finishing each other's sentences, and	1
Um, I could imagine that as - there's a fair number of	0
and this is sort of, not  really  hostile,  but sort of  competitive,  where	0
one  person is  finishing  something and	0
you have, like,  two  or  three  people jumping - trying to -	0
Trying to  get  the floor.	0
trying to, uh  grab  the next  turn.	0
And so it's  not  against the person who talks  first	0
because actually we're all  waiting  for that person to  finish.	0
But they  all  want to  be  next.	0
I have a  feeling  most of these things are - that -	1
a benevolent kind are - are	1
are - are  competitive  as opposed to real- really -  really  hostile. But.	1
Yeah, I agree. I agree.	0
I wonder what determines who  gets  the floor?	0
Well, there are  various  things, you - you have the -	0
Uh a vote - vote in Florida.  Yeah.	0
It's been studied a  lot.	0
Um, o- one thing - I - I wanted to -	0
or you can tell a good joke and then everybody's laughing and you get a chance to g- break in. But. But.	0
You know, the  other  thing I was thinking was that,  um  these -	1
all  these interesting  questions  are, of course, pretty  hard  to  answer  with, uh u-	1
you know, a small amount of  data.	1
So, um  I  wonder  if what you're saying	0
suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have,	0
a - a fair number of meetings	0
a  smaller  number of people.	0
we - most of our meetings are	1
uh, meetings currently with say five, six, seven, eight people	1
really  try to  have  some two-person meetings,  or some three-person meetings and re- record them	1
just to - to - to	1
beef up the - the  statistics  on that?	1
it seems like there are  two  possibilities there, I mean	0
y- like a  meeting,  w-	0
is not as  similar  as the rest of the -	0
It depends on what you're after, of course, but	0
It seems like  that  would be more a case of the  control  condition, compared to, uh  an  experimental	0
condition, with  more  than two.	0
Well, Liz was raising the question of - of whether i- it's the number - there's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there,	0
If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you'd still have the visuals. You wouldn't have that difference   also  that you have in the	0
Yeah, I'm just thinking that'd be more like a c-  control  condition.	0
Well, but from the  acoustic  point of view,	0
Yeah,  acoustic  is fine, but -	0
If - if the goal were to  just  look at  overlap  you would -	1
you could serve yourself -  save  yourself a lot of  time  but not even transcri- transcribe the  words.	1
Well, I was thinking you  should  be able to do this	1
from the   acoustics,  on the  close-talking  mikes, right?	1
Well, that's - the - that was my - my status report, so	0
Right, I mean Adam was -	0
You've been  working  on that.	0
right. I mean, not as well as what - I mean, you wouldn't be able to have any kind of  typology,  obviously, but	0
Once we're done with  this  stuff  discussing,	0
you'd get some rough statistics.	0
what - what do you think about that?	0
Do you think that would be useful? I'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two-person meetings or something.	0
I guess my - my first comment was, um  only that	1
we should n- not attribute  overlaps  only to meetings, but maybe that's obvious, maybe	1
everybody knew that, but that	1
conversation with two people there's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap, and that it would be interesting	1
look at  whether there  are  these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned, that	1
what maybe the  additional  people add to this competition that happens  right  after a turn,	1
you know, because now you can have  five  people trying to grab the turn, but pretty quickly	0
there're - they back  off  and you go back to this sort of	0
only one person at a time with one person	0
So, I don't know. To answer your question I  it - I don't think it's	1
controls but I think it's worth recording all the meetings we	1
I  -  I  have an idea.	0
D- I wouldn't  not  record a two-person meeting just because it only has two people.	0
we have - have in the  past  and I think  continue  - will  continue  to have a fair number of  uh  phone  conference calls.	1
Yeah, we  talked  about this repeatedly.	0
as another c-  c-  comparison   condition,  we could	1
what  happens  in terms of  overlap,  when you  don't  have visual contact.	1
It just seems like that's a very  different   thing than what we're doing.	0
I mean   physically   can we  record  the o- the other -	0
Well, we'll have to set  up  for it.	0
Well, we're not really set up for it	1
this is getting a little  extravagant,	1
blinds  or something to -	1
That's what they  did  on Map Task,	0
They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without	0
visual cues and it's quite interesting.	0
Well, we - we record this meeting so  regularly  it wouldn't be that -	0
I mean  a little  strange.	0
O_K, we can  record,  but  no  one can  look  at each other.	0
Well, we could just put  b-  blindfolds  on.	0
Well y- no you - f- Yeah, Yeah.	0
and we'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds.	0
Oh, th-  that  was the  other  thing, weren't we gonna take a picture	1
at the beginning of each of these meetings?	1
Um, what - I had	1
thought  we were gonna do is just take pictures of the  whiteboards.	1
rather than take pictures of the  meeting.	1
Linguistic anthropologists would - would suggest it would be useful to	0
There's a head nodding here vigorously, yeah.	0
also take a picture of the  meeting.	0
Why - why do we want to have a picture of the meeting?	0
because you get then the  [MASK] of the  speakers.	1
Well, you could do that by just  noting  on the  enrollment  sheet the -	1
Seat  number, that's a good idea.	1
I'll do that. I'll do that on the next set of forms.	1
Yeah. Is possible to get information from the  rhythmic  - f- from the  ge- , eh  uh, files.	0
So you'd  number  them somehow.	0
I  finally  remembered to put, uh	0
We can - can't you figure it out from the  mike  number?	0
put native language on the  newer  forms.	0
And even the  jacks,  I mean, I'm sitting here and the jack is  over  in front of you.	0
But  probably  from these you could've  infer it.	0
It would be another  task.	0
It's - it would be trivial -	0
It would be a research task.	0
Having - having ground tu- truth would be  nice,  so   seat  number would be good.	0
You know where you could get it?	0
[MASK]  during the  digit   uh stuff.	0
So I'm gonna put little  labels  on all the  chairs  with the  seat  number. That's a good idea.	1
Not the  chairs.  The  chairs  are -	0
But you have to keep the chairs in the same pla- like here.	0
Like,  put them on the  table  where they -	1
But you know, they - the - s-	0
the linguistic  anthropologists  would say it would be good to have a digital picture  anyway,  because you get	0
a sense also of  posture.	0
Posture, and we could like,	0
block out the person's  face  or whatever but -	0
but, you know,  these  are  important  cues, I mean the -	0
How big their  heads  are.	0
how a person is sitting  is -	0
But if you just f-	0
Andreas  was  wearing  that  same  old  sweater  again.	0
But from one picture, I don't know that you really get that. Right?	0
You'd want a video for that, I think.	0
It'd be better than  nothing,  is - is -	0
i- Just from a  single  picture I think you can tell  some  aspects.	0
I mean I - I could  tell  you I mean, if I- if I'm in certain  meetings  I notice that there are certain people who	0
The body language is very uh -	0
is very interesting in terms of the [MASK]	0
Morgan  had that  funny   hair  again.	0
Well, I mean you black out the -  that  part. But it's just, you know, the - the body	0
Of course, the -  where  we sit at the  table,  I find is  very   interesting,  that we do tend to  cong-  to	0
gravitate  to the  same   place  each  time.	0
and it's  somewhat   coincidental.  I'm sitting  here  so that I can	0
run into the  room  if the  hardware  starts, you know,  catching   fire  or  something.	0
Oh, no, you - you just like to be in  charge,  that's why you're sitting -	0
I just want to be at the  head  of the  table.	0
Speaking  of taking  control,  you said you had some research  to talk about .	0
Yeah, I've been playing with, um	1
uh, using the  close-talking  mike to do - to  try  to figure out who's  speaking.	1
So my  first  attempt was just using [MASK]  that we talked about - about two weeks ago,	1
and so I played with that a little bit, and	0
it works O_ K,   except that	0
it's  very  sensitive to your choice of	0
your filter width and your	0
So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone's talking and when they're not.	1
But if you try to use the same parameters on another  speaker,  it doesn't work anymore,  even if you normalize it based on	1
But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole  meeting?	0
It  does  work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting.	1
How did you do it Adam?	0
How  did I  do  it? What do you mean?	0
I mean, wh- what was the -	0
o- every frame that's over the [MASK]	1
and then look for runs.	1
So there was a  minimum  run length, so that -	1
Every frame that's over  what  threshold?	0
A  threshold  that you  pick.	0
So you take a - each frame, and you compute the energy and if it's over the threshold you set it to  one,  and if it's under the threshold you set it to  zero,	1
so now you have a  bit  stream  of zeros and ones.	1
And then I  [MASK]  that	1
using, um  a fairly long  [MASK]	1
Uh  well, actually I guess depends on what you mean by  long,  you know, tenth of a second sorts of numbers.	1
and that's to average out	1
And that works O_ K,  if you fil- if you tune the filter parameters, if you tune  how long your [MASK]is and how high you're looking for your thresholds.	1
Did you ever try running the filter  before  you pick a threshold?	0
I  had  the program  mostly  written  already  so it was  easy  to  do.	0
O_K and then the  other  thing I did, was I took	1
Javier's  speaker-change  detector - acoustic- change  detector, and I implemented  that  with the close-talking  mikes,	1
and   unfortunately  that's not working real well, and it looks like it's -	1
the problem is - he does it in two passes, the first pass	1
is to find  candidate  places to do a break.	1
And he does that using a[MASK] doing broad  phone  classification and he	1
the, uh   one  of the phone classes is silence.	1
And so the  possible   breaks  are where  silence  starts and ends.	0
And then he has a  second  pass which is a modeling - [MASK]	1
whether it  improves  or - or  degrades  to split  at  one of those particular places.	1
And what looks like it's  happening  is that the -	1
even on the  close-talking  mike	1
the broad phone class classifier's doing a really bad job.	1
Who  was it  trained  on?	0
Uh, I have no idea. I don't remember.	0
Does an- do you remember, Morgan, was it Broadcast News?	0
So, at any rate, my  next  attempt,  which I'm in the  midst  of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the	1
as the way of generating the candidates.	1
Because one of the things that  definitely   happens  is if you  put  the threshold  low   you get  lots  of breaks.	0
All  of which are  definitely  acoustic events.	0
But, like, it could be someone who isn't the person  here,  but the person over  there  or it can be the person  breathing.	0
And then feeding  that  into the [MASK]	1
And so I think  that  might  work.	0
But, I haven't gotten very far on that.	0
But  all  of this is close-talking mike, so	1
it's, uh  just -  just  trying to get some ground truth.	0
I - I - I think, eh	0
when - when, y- I -  I saw the - the - the - the speech from [MASK] and, eh  close   talker. I - I think the	0
there is a - a great difference in the - in the signal.	0
Oh,  absolutely.  So  s- my  intention  for  this  is -  is  as an  aide  for ground  truth.	1
I - I - I mean that eh eh  in the - in the mixed file	0
you can find, uh  zone with, eh	0
great different, eh  level of energy.	0
I - I think for, eh   algorithm based  on energy,	0
h- mmm, - more or less, eh, like eh	0
eh, mmm, first sound energy detector.	0
When y- you the detect the - the - the  first at - at the end  of - of the	0
detector of, ehm princ- um. What is the - the name in  English ? the - the, mmm,	0
the de- detector of, ehm of a word in the - in the s- in -	0
in - in the  background	0
I'm - I'm not sure what you're  saying,  can you try -	0
I mean that when - when you use, eh  eh   any	0
I think he's saying the    [MASK]	0
I - I think it's probably  to work  well eh, because, eh  you have eh, in the mixed files a  great  level of energy.	0
eh  and great difference between the  sp-  speaker.	0
And probably is not so easy	0
when you use the - the [MASK], eh that -	0
Because the signal is, eh  the - in the e- energy level.	0
in - in that, eh  eh  speech file  is, eh  more similar.	0
between the different eh, speaker,  um	0
I - I think is - eh, it will  i- is my opinion.  It will be, eh  more difficult to - to detect	0
I think that, um  In the [MASK] Yeah.  Yeah. And the - the another question, that when	0
Ah, in the clo- in the P_D_ A,  you mean?  Absolutely. Yeah, no  question.  It'll be  much  harder.  Much  harder.	0
I review the - the - the work of Javier. I think the, nnn, the, nnn,  that the idea of using a  neural network	0
to - to get [MASK]eh  from, eh uh	0
a candidate from the - the - the [MASK]	0
uh, I'm considering, only because Javier, eh  only consider, eh  like candidate, the, nnn, eh  the silence, because it is the - the only model, eh - eh, he used that, eh   eh  nnn,	0
the - the possibility of a - a change between the - between the speaker,  Um  another - another research thing, different groups, eh  working, eh  on Broadcast News  prefer to, eh	0
Yeah, when a   phone  changes.	0
Because, I - I - I think it's more realistic that, uh  only consider the -  the  the - the silence between the speaker.  Eh  there - there  exists	0
eh  silence between - between, eh  a speaker.	0
is - is, eh  eh  acoustic, eh	0
event, important to - to consider.	0
I - I found that the, eh  silence in - in many occasions in the - in the speech file,  but, eh  when you have, eh  eh, two speakers together	0
without enough silence between - between  them , eh	0
eh  is better to use the a[MASK] basically and I - I - I	0
[MASK]or, mmm,  BIC   criterion for consider all the frames	0
Yeah, the - you know, the reason that he, uh  just used silence	0
was not because he thought it was  better,	0
it was - it was - it was the place he was  starting.	0
So, he was trying to get something going, and, uh e- e- you know, as - as -	0
as is in  your  case, if you're here for only a modest number of months you try to	0
But his - his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also.	0
But, eh  do - do you think that if you consider all the frames	0
to detect the - the - the different acoustic change,  eh  between speaker, without, uh  with, uh  silence or  with overlapping, uh, I think like - like, eh  eh	0
eh  way of process the - the acoustic change.	0
In a first step, I mean.	0
eh  without considering the you - you - you, um  you can consider the energy	0
like a- another parameter in the - in [MASK] eh.	0
This -  this  is the idea. And if, if you do that, eh  eh, with a  BIC   uh criterion for example, or with another kind of, eh  of  distance  in a first step,  and then you, eh  you get the, eh  the hypothesis	0
to the -  this  change acoustic,  eh	0
Because, eh  eh, probably you - you can find the - the	0
eh  a small gap of silence between speaker  with eh  eh  a ga- mmm,	0
Less than,  eh  two hundred milliseconds for example  and apply another - another algorithm, another approach like, eh  eh  detector of  ene- , eh detector of  bass-tone  energy to - to consider that, eh	0
of s- a small silence between speaker,  or	0
another algorithm to - to process,  eh  the - the segment between marks	0
eh  founded by the - the	0
the  [MASK]   criterion and applied for - for each frame. I think is, eh	0
it will be a- an - an - a more general approach	0
the  if we compare - with use, eh  [MASK] or another, eh  speech recognizer with a broad class or - or narrow class, because, in my opinion	0
eh  it's in my opinion,  eh	0
if you - if you change	0
the condition of the speech, I mean, if you adjust to your algorithm with a mixed speech file and to, eh	0
the neural net, eh  used by Javier with a mixed file.	0
With a m-  mixed  file,	0
with a - the mix,	0
and then you - you, eh	0
you try to - to apply that, eh, eh, eh, speech recognizer to that signal, to [MASK] eh  speech file,  I -	0
you will have problems, because the - the - the - the  condition  you - you will need t- t- I - I suppose that you will need to -	0
Oh,  absolutely.  This is - this is not what I was suggesting to do.	0
Look, I - I think this is a -	0
It's a - I used to work,  like , on voiced - on voice silence detection, you know, and this is this  kind of thing.	0
have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing, and they work on it for a couple months,	0
they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily.	0
Then you say, "O_K, I don't just wanna get most of the cases I want it to be really accurate."	0
Then it gets  really  hard no matter what you do.	0
So, the p- the problem is is that if you say, "Well	0
I have these  other  data over  here,	0
that I  learn  things from, either explicit training of neural nets or of Gaussian mixture models or whatever."	0
Suppose you  don't  use any of those things. You say you have	0
looked for acoustic change. Well, what does that  mean?	0
That - that means you set some  thresholds  somewhere or something, right?	0
and - and so  where do you get your  thresholds  from?	0
From something that you  looked  at. So	0
you  always  have this problem, you're going to  new  data	0
H- how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data?	1
Uh, if it's gonna be different from old data that you have?	1
And I think that's a problem	1
Well, also what  I'm  doing right now is  not   intended  to be an acoustic change detector for far-field  mikes.  What  I'm  doing	1
is trying to use the  close-talking  mike	1
Can-  and just generate candidate and just   try  to get a  first   pass  at something that  sort  of  works.	1
and I  haven't  spent a lot of  time  on it and I'm not  intending  to spend a lot of time on it.	0
um, I, unfortunately, have to run, but, um	1
I can imagine  uh building  a  um	1
model of speaker change  detection  that	1
takes into account  both the  far-field  and the	1
uh  actually,  not  just the  close-talking  mike for that  speaker,  but actually for  all  of th-	1
for  all  of the speakers.	1
If you  model  the -	0
your  microphone and everybody else's microphone, as  well  as on that,	0
and you build, um -	0
basically I think you'd - you would	0
as a  state  space all of the  possible   speaker  combinations	0
It's not that big actually, um	0
Two to the  N_ .	0
Two to the number of people in the meeting.	0
Actually, Andreas may- maybe - maybe just something  simpler  but - but	0
along the lines of what you're saying, I was just realizing, I used to know this guy who used to build, uh	0
um,  mike  mixers - automatic  mike  mixers where, you know, t- in order to able to turn up the gain,	0
as much as you  can,  you -	0
you - you  lower  the gain on - on the mikes of people who aren't  talking,  right?	0
And then he had some sort of	0
reasonable way of  doing  that, but	1
uh, what if you were just looking at very  simple  measures  like  [MASK] but you  don't  just compare it to some  threshold    overall  but you compare it to the  energy  in  the other  microphones.	1
I was  thinking  about doing that  originally  to find out	1
and  that  person is  certainly   talking.	0
But I  also  wanted to find  threshold  - uh, excuse me, mol-  overlap.	1
So, not just - just the loudest.	0
Sorry. I - I have found that when - when I	0
Sorry, I have to go.	0
I analyzed the - the speech files from the,  eh  mike, eh  from the eh close eh  microphone, eh  I found zones	0
Could you fill that out anyway?	0
Just,  put your name in.	0
Are y- you want me to do it? I'll do it.	0
But  he's  not gonna even  read  that.	0
with a - a different level of energy.	0
because, eh  eh  depend on the position of the - of the microph- of the each speaker  to, eh, to get	0
more o- or less energy	0
i- in the mixed sign- in the signal.	0
and then,  if you consider energy to - to detect overlapping	0
in - in, uh, and you process the - the - in - the - the - the speech file from the - the - the mixed signals.  The mixed signals, eh.	0
I - I think it's - it's difficult, um   only to  en-  with energy to - to consider that in that zone	1
We have eh, eh, overlapping zone	1
Eh, if you process only the the energy of the, of each frame.	1
Well, it's probably harder, but I - I think what I was s-	1
just when he - when Andreas  raised  that, was that there's  other  information to be gained from looking at all	1
of the microphones and you may not need to look at very  sophisticated  things,	1
if  most  of the overlaps -	0
you know, this doesn't cover, say,  three,  but if  most  of the overlaps, say, are  two,	0
if the distribution looks like there's a  couple   high  ones and - and  the rest of them are  low,  you know, what I mean,  there's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures.	0
And everyone else is low, yeah.	0
Uh, by the way, I had an idea with - while I was watching Chuck nodding at a lot of these things, is that we can all wear little bells on our heads,	0
then you'd know that -	0
I think that'd be really interesting  too,  with blindfolds.	0
Nodding with blindfolds, "what are you  nodding  about?"	0
Yeah.  The question is,  like  whether -	0
Well, trying with and -	0
"Sorry, I'm just - I'm just going to sleep."	0
But then there's just  one   @@ , like.	0
Actually,  I  saw a uh - a woman at the  bus  stop the other day who, um, was talking on her  cell  phone	0
speaking Japanese, and was  bowing.	0
Oh, yeah, that's really common.	0
It's very difficult if you try - while you're trying, say, to convince somebody on the phone it's difficult not to move your hands.	0
You know, if you watch people they'll actually  do  these things. So.	0
I still think we should try a - a meeting or two with the blindfolds, at  least  of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of	0
Um, maybe for  part  of the meeting, we don't have to do it the  whole  meeting.	0
I think it's a  great  idea.	0
It'll be too hard to make barriers, I was thinking because they have to go all the way	1
you know, I can see  Chuck  even if you put a barrier  here.	0
Well, we could  just  turn out the  lights.	0
I - I can say I  made  barr- barriers for -	0
the  stuff I was doing with  Collin  wha-	0
this  kind of foam board.	0
R-  really  inexpensive. You can - you can masking tape it together, these are	0
you know, pretty l- large partitions.	0
But then we  also  have  these  mikes, is the other thing I was thinking, so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb	1
It's true, it would disturb the, um  the -	0
the long-range - it would -	0
Probably we should wait until after Adam's set up the  mikes,	0
I mean, it sounds weird but - but -	0
Be interesting to have the camera going.	0
I think we're going to have to work on the, uh -	0
on the human subjects  form.	0
Yeah, that's  right,  we didn't  tell  them we would be  blindfolding.	0
"Do you mind being  blindfolded  while you're interviewed?"	0
that's - that's - that's the one that we videotape.	0
Um, I - I wanna move this along.	0
I  did  have this other agenda item which is, uh  @@  - it's uh a list which I sent to uh - a  couple  folks,	0
but um I wanted to get broader input on it,	1
So this is the things that I  think  we did	1
in the last three months	1
obviously not  everything  we did but - but sort of  highlights  that I can -	0
can  tell  s- some  outside  person, you know, what - what were you  actually  working  on.	0
Um  in no particular order	1
uh,  one,  uh, ten more hours of meeting r-  meetings  recorded,	1
you know from - from, uh	1
and uh  sent to I_B_M.	0
[MASK] put together and sent to I_B_M for transcription,	1
uh  next batch of recorded data put together on the C_D-ROMs for shipment to I_B_M,	1
Hasn't  been  sent  yet,  but  -	0
yeah, that's why I  phrased  it that way,	0
human subjects approval on campus,	1
uh  and release forms worked out so the meeting participants have a chance to request [MASK] of	1
selected parts of the spee- their speech.	1
audio pixelization software written and tested.	1
preliminary analysis of overlaps in the pilot data we have transcribed,	1
and  exploratory   analysis of [MASK] that was - I was -	1
wasn't   sure  if those were the right way -	1
that was the right way to  describe  that because of that little exercise that -	1
that you  and - and Lokendra did.	1
I - well, I- I'm probably  saying  this wrong, but what I said was [MASK]	0
a lot of that was from, you know, what -	0
what - what you two were doing so I - I sent it to you, and	0
you know, please mail me, you know, the corrections or suggestions for changing I - I don't want to make this twice it's length but -	0
Is there anything anybody -	0
I - I did a  bunch  of  stuff  for  supporting  of  digits.	0
"Bunch of stuff for s-" O_K, maybe - maybe send me a  sentence  that's a little thought through about that.	0
So,  O_K, I'll send you a sentence that doesn't just say "a bunch of"?	0
" stuff " is probably bad too,	0
"Stuff"  is not very technical.	0
phrase it in passive voice.	0
" range  of  things ",	0
and - and you know, I sort of	0
what  you  did with what  Jane  did on - in - under the, uh	0
Thilo, can you tell us about all the work  you've  done on this project in the last, uh  last three months? That's -	0
So - what is - what -	0
Um,  I didn't get it. Wh- what is "audio pixelization"?	1
Uh, audio pix- wh- he  did  it, so why don't you  explain  it quickly?	0
It's just, uh   beeping  out parts that you don't want included in the meeting so, you know	1
you can say things like, "Well, this should  probably  not be on the  record,  but beep"	0
Yeah. We - we - we spent a - a - a fair amount of time early on just talk- dealing with this issue about  op w- e- e-	0
we realized, "well, people are speaking in an impromptu  way  and they might say something that would embarrass them or others later", and,	0
how do you get  around  that so in the consent form it says, well	0
we will look at the transcripts later and if there's something that you're	0
O_K, and you can say -	0
But you don't want to just totally excise it because	0
uh, well you have to be  careful  about excising it, how - how you excise it keeping the timing right and so forth so that at the  moment	0
tho- th- the idea we're running with is - is h- putting the beep over it.	0
Yeah, you can either  beep  or it can be  silence.  I - I couldn't  decide.	0
which was the  right  way to do it.  Beep  is good  auditorily,	0
if someone is  listening  to it, there's no mistake that it's been beeped out,	0
but for  software  it's probably better for it to be  silence.	0
No,  no. You can - you know, you could make a m-	0
as long as you keep using the same  beep,	0
people  could make a  model  of that  beep,  and -	0
And I use - it's - it's, uh	0
I think the beep is a really good idea.	0
It's  very   clear.  Then you don't think it's a long pause.	0
Yeah, it's  more   obvious  that there  was  something  there  than if there's just silence.	0
Yeah, that - I mean, he's - he's  removing  the old   thing  and - and - and -	0
But I mean if you just replaced it with  silence,	0
it's not clear whether that's really  silence  or -	0
One - one question. Do you do it on  all  channels?	0
Yeah, I like that. Very clear.	0
Yeah you have to do it on all channels because it's, uh   audible.	0
Uh, it's - it's  potentially  audible, you could potentially recover it.	0
Ke- keep a back door.	0
Well, the other thing that - you know, I mean the - the alternative might be to s-	0
Well, I - I  haven't  thrown away any of the meetings that I beeped. Actually yours is the only one that I beeped and then, uh	0
Notice how  quiet  I am.	0
Sorry, and then the  DARPA  meeting I just excised  completely,  so it's in a private directory.	0
You have   some  people who  only  have beeps as their speech in these meetings.	0
They're easy to find, then.	0
Alright, so, uh  I think we should, uh  uh, go on to the digits?	0
I have one concept a- t- I - I want to say,	0
which is that I think it's nice that you're preserving the  time  relations,	0
s- so you're - you're not just cutting - you're not doing  scissor  snips. You're - you're keeping the, uh	0
the time duration of a -  de - deleted - deleted part.	0
Yeah, since we wanna  possibly synchronize these things as well.	0
Oh, I should have  done  that. Shoot.  Oh well.	0
So I guess if there's an overlap,	0
like, if I'm saying something that's  bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped, too?	0
You'll lose it. There's no way around that.	0
I d- I did -	0
before we do the digits, I did also wanna remind people, uh	0
please do send me, you know,	0
thoughts for an agenda, yeah that - that would be	0
So that, uh, people's ideas don't get   yeah, well	0
Thursday crept up on me this week.	0
it does creep up, doesn't it?	0
And,  I  wanted to say, I think this is really  interesting	0
analysis.  I  meant  to say that before I started off on the   Switchboard  stuff. It's  neat.	0
I was gonna say "can you do that for the other meetings, can you do it for them?" And,  no  actually, you  can't.	0
Yeah.  Does it take -	0
Actually - actually I - I thought that's what you were giving us was  another   meeting  and I was like, "Oh, O_K!"	0
How long does it  take, just briefly, like	0
I  have  the  script  now, so, I mean, it can work off the, uh	0
As soon as we get labels, yep.	0
But it has to be  hand-labeled   first?	0
Uh, well,  yeah.  Because, uh  well, I mean	0
once  his  - his algorithm is up and running	0
If it  works  well enough.	0
then we can do it  that  way.	0
But  I - I just worked off of my	0
Not  quite  to the point where it works.	0
I think - what I - what this has, uh, caused me - so this  discussion	1
caused me to wanna  subdivide  these further. I'm gonna take a look at the, uh  backchannels, how much we have	1
anal- I hope to have that for next time.	1
Yeah, my - my algorithm worked  great  actually on  these,	0
but when you wear it like  that  or with the	0
or if you have it  very  far from your  face,  that's when it starts  failing.	0
Well, I can wear it,	0
I mean if you -	0
I mean, we  want  it to  work,   right?	0
I - I don't want  to  change  the way we do the meeting.	0
I feel like this  troublemaker.	0
so, it was just a  comment  on the  software,  not a comment on	0
prescriptions on how you wear  microphones.	0
Get the bolts, "whh whh"	0
O_K, that's - let's - let's - let's do digits.	0
Do you want us to put a  mark  on the  bottom  of these when they've actually been  read,  or	0
the only one that  wasn't  read is -	0
is known, so we don't do it.	0
