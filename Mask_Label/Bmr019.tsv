So, I mean, everyone who's on the wireless check that they're on.	0
O_K, our agenda was quite short.	0
Oh, could you  close the door, maybe? Yeah.	0
Sure. Two items, which was, uh,	1
digits and  possibly  stuff on - on, uh, [MASK] which  Jane  said that Liz and Andreas had in- information on, but they didn't, so.	1
I guess the only other thing, uh, for which I -	0
We should do that second, because Liz might join us in time for that.	0
Um. O_K, so there's digits, [MASK] and, um,	0
I guess the other thing,	0
which I came unprepared for, uh,	0
is, uh, to dis- s- s- see if there's anything anybody wants to discuss about the Saturday meeting.	0
Any - I mean, maybe not.	0
Talk about aligning people's schedules.	0
Yeah. I mean - Right. Yeah, I mean, it was -	0
Yeah, it's  [MASK] of people's schedules.	0
Yeah. If we're very -	0
With - with - whatever it was, a  month  and a half or something ahead of time, the only time we could find in common -  roughly  in common, was on a Saturday.	0
Have - Have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of -  in more of the meeting?	0
I - I mean, I don't know, if we had the - if we had the telephone on the table -	0
No. But, h- I mean, he probably has to go  do  something. Right?	0
No, actually I - I have to - I have to shuttle  kids from various places to various other places.	0
So. And I don't have - and I don't, um, have a cell phone so I can't be having a conference call while driving.	0
No.  It's not good. That's not good.	0
R- r- right. So we have to - we -	0
Plus, it would make for interesting noise - background noise.	0
So we have to equip him with a - with a -  with a head-mounted, uh, cell phone and -	0
Ye- we- and we'd have to force you to read lots and lots of digits, so it could get real -  real car noise.	0
And with the kids in the background. Yeah.	0
I'll let - I'd let -	0
I let, uh, my five-year-old have a try at the digits, eh.	0
So, anyway, I can talk about digits. Um, did everyone get the results or shall I go over them again?	0
I mean that it was basically - the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well.	1
Um, and in retrospect that's not as surprising	0
it  shouldn't  have been as surprising as I - as - as I  felt  it was.	0
The lapel mike is a very high-quality microphone.	0
And as Morgan pointed out, that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and  clothes  rustling  if no one else is  talking.	0
Well, it's - Yeah, sort of the bre- the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that, the lapel's gonna be better on.	0
The lapel is typically  worse  on the - on clothes rustling, but if no one's rustling their clothes,	0
Right. I mean, a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits, so it's - it's a very	0
different task than sort of the natural. So.	0
Yeah.  You don't move much during reading digits, I think.	0
Probably the fact that it picks up other people's speakers - other people's  talking  is an indication of that it - the fact it  is  a good microphone.	0
Right. So in the  digits,  in most - most cases, there weren't other people talking. So.	0
D- do the lapel mikes have any directionality to them?	0
Because I - I suppose you could  make  some that have sort of - that you have to orient towards	0
your mouth, and then it would -	0
They have a  little  bit, but they're not noise-cancelling. So, uh -	0
They're - they're  intended  to be omni-directional.	0
And th- it's - and because you don't know how people are gonna put  them   on, you know.	0
So, also, Andreas, on that one the -	0
the  back  part of it should be right against your head.	0
And that will he- keep it from flopping aro- up and down as much.	0
It is against my head.	0
Um. Yeah, we actually talked about this in the, uh, front-end meeting this morning, too.	0
Much the same thing, and - and it was -	0
uh, I mean,  there  the point of interest to the group was  primarily  that, um,	1
the, uh - the system that we had that was based on [MASK]  that's used by, you know,   all  the participant	1
than the - than [MASK]  And the interesting thing is that even though,	1
yes, it's a digits task and that's a relatively small number of words and	1
there's a bunch of digits that you train on,	1
it's just  not  as  good	1
as having a - a l- very large amount of data and training up a - a - a nice good big	1
[MASK] Um, also you had the adaptation in [MASK] which we didn't have in this.	1
Di- did I send you some results without adaptation?	0
No. Or if you did, I didn't include them, cuz it was -	0
I- s- I think Stephane, uh, had seen them. So -	0
Yeah, I think I did, actually.	0
So there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation.	1
A - a - a couple percent or some- I mean -	0
Well, I don't know it - Overall -	0
Uh, I - I don't remember, but there was -  there was a significant,	0
loss or win  from adaptation - with - with adaptation.	0
that was [MASK] And then there was a very small -	0
like point one percent on the natives - uh, win from doing,	0
And  I tried both means adaptation and means and variances, and the variances added another - or subtracted another point one percent. So,	0
it's, um - that's the number there. Point six, I believe, is what you get with	0
both, uh, means and [MASK]	0
But I think one thing is that, uh, I would  presume  -	0
Hav- Have you ever t-	0
Have you ever  tried  this exact same recognizer out on [MASK]	0
This exact same recognizer? No.	0
It might be interesting to do that. Cuz my - my - cuz my sense,	0
But - but, I have - I mean, people - people at [MASK] are actually working on digits.	0
I bet it would do even slightly better.	0
I could - and they are using a system that's,	0
you know, h- is actually  trained  on digits,	0
um, but h- h- otherwise uses the same,	0
you know, decoder, the same,	0
methods, and so forth, and I could ask them what they get  on [MASK]	0
Yeah, bu- although I'd be - I think it'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system so that these numbers were comparable and try it out on [MASK]	1
Mm-hmm. Well, Adam knows how to run it, so you just	0
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz our sense from the other - from [MASK] uh, task is that - I mean, cuz we were getting sub one percent	0
And try it with [MASK]	0
one - so there were a number of things we noted from this. One is, yeah, [MASK] -	1
this, you know, very limited [MASK]	0
Uh, but the other is that, um, the digits	1
recorded here in this room with these close mikes, i- uh, are actually a lot  harder  than the  studio-recording [MASK]	1
I think, you know, one reason for that, uh, might be that there's still - even though it's [MASK] there still is  some  noise and  some  room acoustics.	0
And another might be that, uh, I'd - I would  presume  that in the studio, uh, uh, situation recording read speech that if somebody	0
did something a little funny or n- pronounced something a little funny or made a little - that they didn't include it, they made  them   do it again.	0
Whereas, I took out  the ones that I  noticed  that were blatant - that were correctable.	0
So that, if someone just read the wrong digit, I corrected it. And then there was another one where Jose	0
couldn't tell whether - I couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six.  And I asked  him  and he couldn't tell either.	0
So I just cut it out.	0
You know, so I just e- edited out the first, i- uh, word of the utterance.	0
Um, so there's a  little  bit of correction but it's definitely not as clean as [MASK]	0
So my expectations is [MASK] would, especially -	0
I think [MASK] is all  American English. Right? So it would probably do even a little better still	0
on [MASK] but we could give it a try.	0
Well. But   remember,  we're using [MASK] here, uh, on this, uh -	1
um, I was - I thought that maybe that's actually a good thing because it - it gets rid of some of the - uh, the noises,	0
um, you know, in the -	0
the - below and above the -	0
I suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher-quality recordings you would have to in fact, uh,	1
use models that, uh, were trained on [MASK]	1
data. And of course we can't do that or -	1
Wha- what's [MASK] I thought t-	0
It's [MASK] yeah. It's - in - in fact, we looked it up and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling.	0
Oh, that's right. I - I did look that up. I couldn't remember whether that was [MASK] or one of the other digit tasks.	0
But - but, I would - Yeah. It's - it's easy enough to try, just run it on -	0
Mm-hmm. So, Morgan, you're getting a little  breath  noise. You might wanna move the mike down a little bit.	0
one - one issue -	0
one issue with - with that is that	0
um, the system has this, uh, notion of a  speaker  to - which is used in adaptation, variance norm- uh, you know,	0
both in, uh, mean and variance normalization and also in	0
Yeah, I noticed the script that extracted it.	0
So does - so th- so does - does, um,	0
[MASK] database have speakers that are known?	0
And is there - is there enough data or a comparable - comparable amount of data to - to what we have in our recordings here?	0
I don't know how many speakers there are,	0
and - and how many speakers per utterance.	0
Well, the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation.	0
Right. Uh, but I'm not so much worried about the adaptation, actually, than - than the, um,	1
If you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the -	1
the warping, uh, factor. So, um -	1
I  strongly  suspect that they have more speakers than we do.	0
Right. But it's not the amount of speakers, it's the num- it's the amount of data  per  speaker.	0
Right. So we - we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent.	0
So, although I - I sort of know how to run it, there are a little - a f- few details here and there that I'll have to  dig out.	0
So th- the system actually	0
extracts the speaker I_D from [MASK]	0
And there's a - there's a script - and that is actually  all  in one script. So there's this one script that parses [MASK]	0
and extracts things like the, um, speaker,	0
uh, I_D or something that can stand in as a speaker I_D. So,	1
we might have to modify that script to recognize the, um, speakers,	1
um, in the - in the, uh, um,  [MASK]  database.	1
Or you can fake - you can	0
fake  names for [MASK] that resemble the names that we use here for the - for the meetings.	0
That would be the, sort of - probably the safest way to do -	0
I might have to do that anyway to - to do - because we may have to do an extract to get the  amount of data per speaker about right.	1
The other thing is, isn't [MASK]  isolated  digits?	0
Or is that another one? I'm - I looked through a  bunch  of the digits t- corp- corpora, and now they're all blurring.	0
Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit.	0
And then others were [MASK]	0
Yeah. Most of [MASK] I think. The - I mean, we h	0
that's - that was [MASK]	0
By the way, I think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr- improve them	1
by, um,  not starting with [MASK] but by taking [MASK] and doing	1
on a small amount of digit data collected	1
Because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics and f- for [MASK] you know, to the noise.	0
And  that  should really improve things, um, further.	0
And then you use those  adapted  models, which are not  speaker  adapted but sort of acous- you know, [MASK] -	0
use  that  as the starting models for your speaker adaptation.	0
But the thing is, uh - I mean, w- when you -	0
it depends whether you're ju- were just using this as a -	0
a starter task for - you know, to get things going for  conversational  or if we're really interested i- in [MASK] And I - I think the answer is  both.	0
And for - for [MASK] over the telephone you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation because	0
somebody  gets on the phone and says a number and then you just want it.	0
This is - this - that one's better. Mm-hmm.	0
You don't - don't, uh -	0
Right. Um, but, you know, I - uh, my impression was that you were actually interested in [MASK]	0
uh, problem, I mean. So,	0
you want to - you want to - That's the obvious thing to  try.  Right? Then, eh - because	0
you - you don't have any - That's where the most m- [MASK] is between the currently used models and the - the r- the set up here. So.	1
Yeah. So that'd be anoth- another interesting data point. I mean, I - I guess I'm saying I don't know if we'd want to do that as the - as -	0
Now you're all watching me.  Alright. This way.	0
It f- it clips over your ears. There you go.	0
If you have a  strong  fe- if you have a  strong  preference, you  could  use this. It's just we - we think it has some spikes. So, uh, we - we didn't use that one.	0
You're all watching.  This is terrible.	0
But you  could  if you want. I don't know.	0
And Andre- Andreas, your - your microphone's a little bit low.	0
Yeah. At any rate, I don't know if w-	0
Yeah.  I don't know if  we  wanna use that as the -	0
So if you see the picture  and then you have to scr-	0
It - it - like this.	0
I - I already adjusted this a number of times. I - I	0
Eh. Yeah, I think these mikes are not working as well as I would like.	0
can't quite seem to -	0
Yeah, I think this contraption around your head is not  working so well.	0
Too many adju- too many adjustments. Yeah.	0
Anyway, what I was saying is that I - I think I probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the  norm,  that we compared all things to.	0
To, uh, the - to have - have all this ad- all this, uh, adaptation.	0
But I think it's an important data point,	1
if you're - if - Yeah.	1
The other thing that - that, uh - of course,	1
what Barry was looking at was - was just that, the near versus far. And, yeah, the adaptation would get	1
th- some of that. But, I think even - even if there was, uh, only a factor of two or something, like I was saying in the email, I think that's -	0
that's a  big  factor. So -	0
Liz, you could also just use the other mike if you're having problems with that one.	0
Yeah. This would be O_K. We - we - we think that this has  spikes  on it, so it's not as good acoustically, but -	0
It's this thing's - This is too big for my head.	0
Yeah, basically your  ears  are too big. I mean, mine are too.	0
No, my - my - But this is too big for my  head.  So, I mean,	0
E- th- everybody's ears are too big for these things.	0
it doesn't - you know, it's sit-	0
Well, if you'd  rather  have this one then it's -	0
To get that, uh, pivoted this way, it pivots like this.	0
And there's a screw that you can tighten.	0
And then it - Right.	0
Right. I already  tried to get it close.	0
So if it doesn't bounce around too much, that's actually good placement.	0
But it looks like it's gonna bounce a lot.	0
So, where were we? Uh -  Yeah.	0
What k- u- By the way, wh-  what  factor of two did you - ? I mean -	0
Oh, yeah. I know what I was go- w-	0
Oh, no, no. It's tha- that - that we were saying, you know, well is - how much worse is far than near, you know. And I mean it depends on which one you're looking at, but for the everybody, it's	0
Oh, th- O_K.  That  factor of two.	0
little under a factor or two.	1
Yeah. I - I know what I was thinking was that maybe, uh,	1
could  actually t- t-  try  at least  looking  at, uh, some of the - the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone, at least from the  good  one.	1
I mean,  before  I thought we'd get, you know, a hundred and fifty percent error or something, but if -	0
if, uh - if we're getting	0
thirty-five, forty percent or something,	0
though, on [MASK] over the whole meeting, during all those silences, you get, like, four hundred percent word error.	0
Right. I understand. But doing the same kind of limited thing -	0
Or - or some high number.	0
Yeah, sure. Get all these insertions. But I'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing	1
as people have done in [MASK] or as - a-	1
Where you know who the speaker is and there's no overlap?	0
And you do just [MASK] for those regions?	0
Yeah. The same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from. Right?	0
Could we do  exactly  the same thing that we're doing now, but do it with [MASK]	1
Yeah, do it with one of - on-	0
Cuz we extract the  times  from [MASK] but you use the  acoustics  fr	1
Right. I understand that. I just meant that - so you have  three choices. There's, um -	0
where that person is talking  only  from the transcripts but the segmentations were -	0
were synchronized. Or you can do [MASK]	0
to determine that, the- you know, within this segment, these really were the times that this person was talking and	0
elsewhere  in the segment other people are  overlapping  and just front-end  those  pieces.	0
Or you can run it on the whole data, which is -	0
But - but - but how did we get the - how did we determine	0
which is, you know, a -	0
uh, that we're testing on	0
in the stuff we reported?	0
and we took cases where the  transcribers  said there was only one person talking here, because no one else had time -	1
any  words in that segment and called that [MASK]	1
And that's what we were getting those numbers from. Right.	1
Tho- good - the good numbers. The bad numbers were from  the segments where there was overlap.	1
Well, we could  start  with the good ones. But anyway - so I think that we should try it once with	1
the same conditions that were used to create  those,  and in those same segments just use one of [MASK]	1
Right. So we - we can do  that.  Yeah.	0
And then, you know, I mean, the thing is if we were getting, uh - what, thirty-five, forty percent, something like that on - on that particular set,	0
uh, does it go to seventy or eighty? Or, does it use up so much memory we can't decode it?	0
It might also depend on  which  speaker th- it is and how close they are to [MASK] I don't know how different they are from each other.	0
You want to probably choose [MASK] that is closest to the speaker.	1
For this particular digit ones, I just picked that one.	0
O_K. So we would then use that one, too, or - ?	0
This is kind of central.	0
You know, it's - so i- but I would - I'd pick that one. It'll be less good for some people than for other, but I - I'd like to see it on the same - exact same data set that - that we did the other thing on. Right?	1
I sh- actually  should've  picked a different one, because  that  could  be why the P_D_A is worse.	1
Because it's further away from most of the people reading digits.	1
That's probably  one  of the reasons.	0
Well, yeah. You could look at, I guess,  [MASK] or something.	0
But the other is, it's very, uh - I mean, even though there's - I'm sure the f- f-	0
the - [MASK] uh, front-end has some kind of pre-emphasis, it's - it's, uh -	0
still, th- it's picking up  lots  of low-frequency energy. So, even discriminating against it, I'm sure some of it's getting through.	0
But, yeah, you're right. Prob- a part of it is just the distance.	0
And aren't these pretty bad microphones?	0
But, I mean, if you listen to it, it sounds O_K. You know?	0
Yeah. When you  listen  to it,	0
uh, [MASK] and the P_D_A - Yeah, th- the P_D_A has higher sound floor but not by a lot. It's really pretty -	0
uh, pretty much the same.	0
I just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose.	0
Cheap in terms of their quality. So.	0
Well, they're  twenty-five cents or so. Yeah.	0
Th- we wanted them to be - to be typical of what would be in a P_D_A. So they are -	0
they're not [MASK] three hundred dollar type. They're the twenty-five cent,	0
buy  them   in packs of thousand type.	0
But, I mean, the thing is people use those little mikes for  everything  because they're  really  not  bad.	0
I mean, if you're not	0
doing something  ridiculous  like feeding it to a speech recognizer, they - they -  they - you know, you can hear the sou- hear the sounds just fine.  You know, it's -	0
They - I mean, i- it's more or less the same  principles  as these other mikes are built under, it's just that  there's less quality control.	0
They just, you know, churn  them   out and don't check  them.	0
So that was - Yeah. So that was i- interesting result. So like I said, the front-end guys are	0
very much interested in - in this is as - as well and	0
So - so, but where is this now? I mean, what's - where do we go from here? I mean,	1
Yeah. That was gonna be my question.	0
we - so we have a - we have a - a system that works pretty well but it's not, you know, the system that	0
people here are  used  to using - to working with. So what - what do we do now?	0
Well, I think what we wanna do is we want to - eh, and we've talked about this in other  contexts - we want to	1
have the ability to feed it different features.	1
from the point of view of the front-end research, it would be s- uh, substituting for [MASK]	1
I think that's the key thing. And then if we can feed it different features, then we can try all the different things that we're trying there.	0
uh, also Dave is - is thinking about	1
using the data in different ways, uh, to	1
explicitly work on reverberation starting with some techniques that some other people have  found somewhat useful, and - Yeah.	1
So - so the key  thing that's missing here is basically the	1
you know, other features  i- into the recognizer and also then to train the system.	1
O_K. And, uh, es- I don't know when Chuck will be back but that's exactly what he - he's gonna -	0
He's - he's  sort  of back, but he drove for fourteen hours an- and wasn't gonna make it in today.	0
I think that's one of the things that he said he would be working on. Um.	0
Just sort of t- to make sure that  we can do that and -	0
It's - uh, I mean, the - the front-end is f- i- tha- that's in [MASK] is very nice in that it	1
does a lot of things on the fly but it unfortunately  is not  designed and, um -  like the, uh, ICSI system is, where you can feed it	1
from a pipeline of - of the command. So,	1
the - what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that	1
you have to, uh, dump out, um -	1
you know, if you want to use some new features, you have to dump them into	1
and  give those files to the recognizer.	0
We do - we tend to do that anyway.	1
Oh. So, although you - you can pipe it as well, we tend to do it that way because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re-doing it over and over.	0
Yeah. So I've - I -	0
So tha- that's exactly what [MASK]  is for.	0
Yeah, the - the - the cumbersome thing is - is, um - is that you actually have to dump out little - little files. So for each segment that you want to recognize  you have to  dump out  a separate file.	1
Just like i- th- like th- as if there were [MASK] but instead you have sort	0
O_K. So the s- the - the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments?	0
I don't know, did  you  wanna talk about it, or - ?	0
I can give a - I was just telling this to  Jane  and - and -	1
we were able to get some	1
definite improvement on [MASK] by	1
looking  at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors  that were occurring and	1
some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition, which is a	0
I think was  both  a - a pruning  problem  and	0
needing constraints on word locations. And so we tried both of these  st-  things. We tried saying -	0
I don't know, I got this  whacky idea that -	0
just from looking at the data, that when people talk  their words are usually chunked together.	0
It's not that they say one word	0
and then there's a bunch of words together.	0
They're   might  say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just [MASK]	0
But in general, if there's, like, five or six words and one word's far  away  from it, that's probably  wrong  on average. So,	0
And then also, ca- [MASK] of course, was too - too severe.	0
So that's actually interesting. [MASK] was the same value that we used for recognition.	0
And we had lowered that - we had used  [MASK] after Liz ran some experiments showing that,	0
you know, it runs  slower  and there's no real difference in -	0
Actually it was  better  with - slightly better or about th- it was the  same  with [MASK]	1
So for [MASK] this -	1
It's probably cuz the recognition's just bad en-	0
at a point where it's  bad  enough that - that you don't lose anything.	0
Um, but it turned out for - for - to get [MASK]  it was really important t	1
Um  because otherwise it would sort of do [MASK] um, in regions where there was no real speech  yet  from the foreground speaker.	0
Um,  so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that,	1
you know, as Liz said the - we f- enforce	1
uh, the foreground speech has to be continuous. It cannot be -	1
you cannot have a background speech	0
hypothesis in the  middle  of the foreground speech. You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end.	0
Yeah. I mean, yeah, it isn't  always  true, and I think what we really want is some  clever  way to do this, where,	1
um, you know, from the  data  or from maybe [MASK] from transcribers that	1
words that  do  occur just by themselves  a- alone, like [MASK] or something that we  did  allow to have background speech around it -	1
those  would be able to do that, but the rest would be constrained.	1
So, I think we have a version that's	1
pretty good for the native speakers. I don't know yet about the non-native speakers.	1
we basically also made [MASK] for the different - sort of grouped some of the  mouth noises together.	0
Um, so, and then there's [MASK]	1
There was some neat - or, interesting cases, like there's one meeting where,	0
um, Jose's giving a presentation and he's talking about,	0
um, the word [MASK] and someone didn't understand,	0
uh, that you were saying " mixed " -	0
And so your speech -ch	0
was s- saying something about [MASK] And the next turn	0
a  lot  of people saying "mixed", like "he means [MASK]" or "I think it's mixed". And the word "mixed" in this  segment  occurs, like, a bunch of times.	0
And Chuck's on the  lapel  here, and he also says "mixed" but it's at the  last  one, and of course the aligner th- aligns it  everywhere  else to  everybody  else's "mixed",	0
cuz there's no adaptation yet. So there's -	0
I think there's some issues about -	0
We probably want to adapt	1
at least the foreground speaker. But, I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker, and that's actually a little bit	1
of a f- funky model. Like, it gives you [MASK] just because often the  background  speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker. So there's some things  there,  especially when you get lots of the same words,	1
uh, occurring in the -	0
I - I think you can do better by	0
uh, cloning - so we have [MASK]	0
And you - and what we wanted to try with - you know, once we have this paper written and have a little more time,	1
uh, t- [MASK] and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker	1
to [MASK] and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker.	1
Right. I mean, in general we actually -	0
and you normally allow those to match to any word. But then the background speech was also [MASK]	0
and so this constraint of [MASK] - you know, it needs to differentiate between the two. So just sort of working through a bunch of	1
And  another  one is turns, like people starting with	0
"well I think" and someone else is  "well how about". So the word "well" is in this -	0
multiple times, and as soon as it occurs usually [MASK] will try to align it to the first person who says it.	0
constraint of sort of -	0
uh,  [MASK] will push it over to the person who  really  said it in general.	0
Is [MASK] a  hard  constraint, or did you do some sort	0
We - we didn't - No. We - w-	0
Right now it's a kluge.	0
O_K. We - it's straightforward to actually just have a - a penalty that doesn't	0
completely disallows it but discourages it.	0
But, um, we just didn't have time to play with, you know, tuning yet another - yet another parameter.	0
And really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have a - we don't have ground truth for these. So,	1
we would need a hand-marked, um,  [MASK] or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw- you know, between the speakers.	1
and then use that as a reference and tune	1
the parameters of the - of the model, uh, to op- to get the best  performance.	1
G- given - I - I mean, I wa- I wa- I was gonna ask you anyway, uh, how you assessed that things were better.	0
I looked at them. I spent  two   days  - um, in  Waves  -	0
Oh, it was  painful  because	0
the thing is, you know the alignments share a lot in common, so -	0
And you're - yo- you're looking at these segments where there's a  lot  of speech. I mean, a lot of them have a lot of words.	0
Not by  every  speaker but by  some  speaker there's a lot of words.	0
No, not - I mean that if you look at the individual	0
segments from just one  person  you don't see a lot of words, but  altogether  you'll see a lot of words up there. And so [MASK] and  pauses  -	0
So I looked at  them   all in Waves and just [MASK]	0
and, at first it sort of looked like a  mess  and then the more I looked at it, I thought "O_K, well it's moving these words leftward and -"	0
You know, it wasn't  that  bad. It was just doing certain things wrong. So - But, I don't,	0
you know, have  time  to l-  to look at all of them and it would be  really  useful to have, like, a - [MASK]	1
um, just mark, like, the beginning and end	0
of the foreground speaker's  real   words  - like, the beginning of the first word, the end of the last word - and then we could,	0
I - O_K. I have to ask you something, which is, first of all, um,	0
you know, do some adjustments.	0
is i- does it  have  to be  Waves?  Because if we could benefit from what  you  did, incorporate that into the present transcripts,  that would help.	0
And then, um, the  other  thing is, I believe that I  did  hand-	0
So. One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber and then I hand-marked it myself so that we  do  have, uh, the beginning and ending of individual  utterances.	0
Um, I didn't do it  word  level, but - but in terms - So I - so for - for one of the N_S_ A  groups. And  also  I went back to the original one that I  first  transcribed and - and did it	0
w- uh, w- uh, utterance by utterance for  that  particular one. So I think you  do  have -	0
if that's a sufficient unit, I think that you  do  have hand-marking for  that.  But it'd be wonderful to be able to	0
benefit from your Waves stuff.	0
We don't care what - what tool you use.	0
O_K. I used it in [MASK] and it's - it's in the -	0
Yeah. I mean, if - if you can, um - if you wanna - well, Jane and I were -	0
just in terms of the  tool,  talking about this. I guess  Sue  had had some  reactions. You know, interface-wise if you're looking at speech, you wanna be able to know really where the words are. And so,	1
Yeah, that's right. Middle of the word, or -	0
we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like, um, and see if you can in-	1
maybe incorporate it into [MASK] some way,  or -	1
Well, I th- I'm thinking just ch- e- e- incorporating it into the  representation.  I mean, if it's - if it's -	0
You mean like -  Yeah,  [MASK]	0
if you have start points, if you have, like,  time  tags, which is what I  assume.  Isn't that what - what you - ? Well, see, Adam would be -	0
Yeah, whatever you use. I mean, we convert it to this format	0
[MASK] And - and then that's the - that's what the -	0
If it - ? O_K. So you would know this more than I would.	0
Yeah.  So, I mean -	0
It  seems  like she - if she's g- if she's moving  time  marks around, since [MASK] it seems like there should be  some  way of - of  using  that -  benefitting  from that.	1
Yeah, it wou- the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you  would  be able - if you were zoomed in  enough	1
in [MASK] to see all the words, you would be able to, like, have the words sort of located in time,	1
if you wanted to do that. So.	0
So - so if we e- e- even just had a - a - It sounds like w- we -	0
Uh, if we - We have two. Yeah.	0
procedure that you have on  that  you could actually get something, um - uh, uh, get an objective measure.	0
You mean on - on the hand-marked, um -	0
So we - we only r- hav- I only  looked  at actually alignments from  one  meeting that we chose, I think [MASK] just randomly, um -	1
Actually,  not  randomly. We knew - we knew that it had these insertion errors from - Yeah.	0
It had sort of  average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers and	0
it was a Meeting Recorder meeting.	0
Um. But, yeah, we should try to  use  what you have. I  did  [MASK] on your new version of	0
[MASK]  I - I mean the - the one with Dan  Ellis in it  and Eric.	0
Uh-huh. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah.	0
I don't think that was the  new  version.	0
That - Yeah, actually it wasn't the new new, it was the medium new. But - but we would - we should do the - the  latest  version. It was the one from last week.	0
Yeah. You - did you adjust the - the utterance times, um, for each channel?	0
Yes, I did. And  furthermore,  I found that there were a certain number where -	0
not - not a  lot,  but several times I actually   moved  an utterance from  Adam's channel to  Dan's  or from  Dan's  to  Adam's.  So there was some speaker identif-	0
And the  reason  was because  I transcribed that at a point before -	0
uh, before we had the multiple  audio  available f-	0
so I couldn't  switch  between the  audio.   I - I transcribed it off of [MASK]  entirely,  which meant in overlaps, I was at a - at a terrific disadvantage.	0
In  addition  it was before [MASK]  uh, possibility was there. And  finally  I did it using the speakers of my, um -	0
of - you know, off the C_P_U on my - on my machine cuz I didn't have a headphone.	0
So it  @@ , like, I mean -	0
Yeah, I - I mean, i- in retrospect  it would've been good to ha-	0
have got- I should've gotten a headphone.	0
But in  any  case, um, thi- this is - this was transcribed in a - in a,	0
uh, less optimal way than - than the ones that came after it, and I was able to - you know, an- and  this  meant that there were some speaker identif- identifications which were	0
Well, I know there were some speaker labeling problems, um, after interruptions. Is that what you're referring to?	1
I mean, cuz there's this one instance when, for example, you're running down the stairs. I remember this meeting really well.	0
Don - Don has had -  He knows - he can just read it like a play.	0
Yeah, I've - I've - I'm very well acquainted with this meeting.	0
"And then  she  said, and then  he  said."	0
Yeah, I know it by heart. So, um,  there's one point when you're running down the stairs. Right? And, like, there's an interruption.	0
You interrupt somebody, but then there's no line after that. For example, there's no speaker identification after that line.	0
Is that what you're talking about? Or were there mislabelings as far as, like, the a- Adam was - ?	0
That was fixed, um, before -	0
i- i- i- I think I- I think I understood that pretty - Thank you for mentioning. Yeah, no, tha- that -	0
Yeah. Cuz I thought I let you know about that. Yeah.	0
That I think went away a couple of versions ago, but it's good to know.	0
O_K. But you're actually saying that certain, uh, speakers were mis- mis-identified.	1
Yeah.  So, with - under - um, uh, listening to [MASK] there were times when, as surprising as that is,	0
I got Adam's voice confused with Dan's and vice versa - not for  long  utterances, but jus- just a couple of places,	0
and embedde- embedded in overlaps. The  other  thing that was w- interesting to me was	1
that I picked up a lot of, um,  backchannels  which were hidden in [MASK] which, you know, I mean, you c- not - not too surprising.	1
But the  other  thing that -	0
I - I  hadn't  thought about this, but I thou- I wanted to raise this when you were -	0
uh, with respect to also a  strategy  which might help with the alignments  potentially,  but that's -	0
When I was looking at [MASK]	1
they were turning up usually -	1
very  often in - w- well, I won't say "usually" - but anyway, very often, I picked them up in a channel	1
w- which was the person who had asked a question.  S- so, like, someone says "an- and have you done the so-and-so?"	1
And then there would be  [MASK]  but it would be the person who asked the  question.  Other people weren't really  doing  much	0
And, you know, sometimes you have the - Yeah, uh-huh.	0
I mean, i- it wouldn't be  perfect,  but - but it  does  seem more natural to give [MASK] when -	0
when you're somehow involved in the  topic,  and the most natural way is for you to have  initiated  the topic by asking a question.	0
I think - No. I think it's - actually I think what's going on is  [MASK]  is something that happens in two-party conversations. And if you ask someone a question, you essentially initiating a little two-party conversation.	0
Well, actu- Yeah, when we  looked  at this -	0
So then you're - so and then you're expected to [MASK] because the person is addressing  you  directly and not everybody.	0
Exactly my point. An- and so this is the expectation thing that - uh, uh, just [MASK] - But in  addition,	0
you know, if someone has  done  this analysis  himself  and  isn't  involved in [MASK]	0
but they might also give [MASK] to verify what - what the answer is that this - that the - the  answerer's  given -	0
I tell you, I say - I say "uh-huh" a  lot,	0
Well, but it's interesting cuz, uh -	0
while people are talking to each other.	0
There  you go. Yeah. Yeah.	0
But there are  fewer  - I think there are fewer "uh-huhs". I mean, just from - We were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would  allow  to have [MASK] in  between  in doing the  alignment.	1
You know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words.	0
"uh-huh" is not as frequent	0
as it sort of would be in [MASK] if you looked at just a word frequency list of one-word	1
short utterances. And " yeah " is way up there, but not "uh-huh". And so I was thinking	1
thi- it's not like  you're being encouraged by everybody else to keep  talking in the meeting. And uh, that's all, I- I'll stop there, cuz I- I think what you say makes a lot of sense.  But it was sort of -	0
Well, that's right. And that would -	0
And what you say is the - is the re- uh, o-  other  side of this, which is that, you know, so	0
th- there are lots of channels where you  don't  have [MASK] w- when a question has been asked and - and these -	0
Right. There's just probably less [MASK]	0
So that's good news, really.	0
in  general,  even if you consider  every  other person altogether one person	0
in the meeting, but we'll find out anyway. We were - I guess the other thing we're - we're - I should say is that we're gonna, um	1
try - compare this type of  overlap  analysis to  [MASK]	1
where - and  [MASK]  where we  have  both sides, so that we can try to answer this question of, you know,	1
is there really  more   overlap  in  meetings  or is it just because we don't have the other channel in  [MASK]  and we don't know what people are doing.	1
Try to create a paper out of that.	0
Yeah. I mean, y- y- you folks have probably  already told me, but were - were you intending to do a Eurospeech submission, or - ?	1
Um, you mean the one due  tomorrow?	0
Yeah. Well, we're still, like, writing the scripts	0
for doing the research, and we will - Yes, we're gonna try.	0
And I was telling Don, do not  take this as an example of how people should work.	0
Do as I say, don't do as I do. Yeah.	0
we will  try.  It'll probably be a little late, but I'm gonna try it.	0
It  is  different. In previous years, Eurospeech only had the  abstract  due by now, not the full paper.	0
And so all our timing was off. I've given up on trying to do digits. I just don't think that what I have so far makes a Eurospeech paper.	0
Well, I'm no- We may be in the same position, and I figured	1
we'll  try,  because that'll at least get us to the point where we have - We have this really nice database format that Andreas and I were working out that -	1
It - it's not very  fancy.  It's just a	1
ASCII line by line format, but it  does  give you information -	1
It's the - it's [MASK]	1
It - Yeah, we're calling these [MASK] after Chafe. I was trying to find what's a word for  a continuous region with  pauses around it?	1
Yeah. I know that th- the Telecom people use - use [MASK] for that. Yes.	0
They do? Oh! Oh. I would jus-	0
And that's - I mean, I - I was using that for a while when I was doing the rate of speech stuff, because I - because I looked up in some books and I found - O_K, I wanna find [MASK]	0
It's just, like, defined by the  acoustics.	0
in which - and - an- because - cuz it's  another  question about how  many pauses they put in  between  them. But how fast do they	0
do  the words within [MASK] Yeah.	0
you know  " Burst " also? Isn't "burst" is used also?	0
Right. Well, that's what we were calling	0
[MASK] has the horrible name overloading with other - with hardware at ICSI.	0
Here.  Just very locally, yeah. But - but that just -	0
Well, well,  Chafe  had this wor- I think it was Chafe, or somebody had a - the word [MASK] originally, and so I -	0
But tha- that's good to know. Was thi- it's Chafe?	0
Well, see, I know S- Sue wrote about [MASK]  But,  in any case, I think it's a good term, and, uh -	0
So maybe we should talk -	0
Maybe it was Sue - ? Y-	0
And ma- maybe - maybe Chafe did. I know - I know Ch- Chafe dealt with -	0
And then it's got all - it's a verb now.	0
But maybe he  speaks  about [MASK] as well and I just don't know. Yeah, go ahead.	0
So what we're doing - uh, this - this is just - maybe someone has s- some - some ideas about how to do it better, but we -	0
So we're taking these, uh, [MASK]	0
from each alignment we're producing, uh, one of [MASK] which essentially has - it's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration.	1
And - and - and of course -	0
It looks like [MASK] almost. Right? It's just -	0
Right. But it has - one - the first column has the meeting  name,  so it could actually contain several meetings. Um.	0
And the second column is the channel.	1
Third column is the, um,  start  times of the words and the fourth column is the  duration  of the words.	1
O_K. Then we have a messy [MASK] where we actually insert into the sequence of words	1
the, uh,  tags  for, like, where - where sentence - ends of sentence, question marks, um,	1
Yeah. These are things that we had Don - So, Don sort of,	0
um, propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber - so whether it was, like, question mark or period or,	0
um, you know, comma and things like that, and we kept the - and [MASK] -	0
uh, kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the	0
[MASK] - sp- overlaps, or -	0
Right. So - so those are actually sort of retro-fitted into [MASK]	0
And then we [MASK] and we sort them by time.	1
then there's a process where you now determine [MASK]	0
Actually, no, you do that before you merge the various channels. So you - you id- identify by some criterion, which is pause length -	0
you identify the beginnings and ends of [MASK] and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight.	0
And then you  merge  everything in terms of, you know, linearizing the sequence based on the  time  marks.	0
the individual channels again, but this time you  know  where the other people start and end talking -	0
you know, where [MASK] start and end.	0
And so you extract the individual  channels,  uh, [MASK] as it were.	1
Um, and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end  tags for overlaps. So,	1
you - you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers' speech.	1
Uh, I mean, I think that's actually really u- useful  also  because	1
even if you weren't studying overlaps, if you wanna get a transcription for [MASK] how are you gonna  know	1
which words from which speakers occurred at which times  relative  to each other? You  have  to be able to  get a transcript like - like this anyway, just for doing [MASK] So,	1
it's - it's sort of -	0
I thi- it's just an issue we haven't  dealt  with before, [MASK] anyway.	0
And - and we -	0
I mean, i- I never thought about it before, but -	0
Y- yes. I mean, s- when I came up with the original data - suggested data format based on [MASK] there's capability of doing	0
that  sort of thing  in  there.	0
Right. But you  can't  get it directly from the  transcription.  Yeah, this is like a poor man's ver-  formatting  version. But it's, you know - It's  clean,  it's just not  fancy.	0
Right. Well, this is - this is just -	0
Well, there's lots of little things. It's like there're twelve different scripts which you run and then at the end you have what you want. But, um,	0
at the very last stage we throw away the actual  time  information. All we care about is whether -	1
that there's a certain word was overlapped by someone  else's  word.	1
So you sort of - at that point, you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap.	1
Because we figure that's about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper.	1
But if you wanted to do a more  fine-grained  analysis and say, you know, how  far  into the word is the overlap, you could do that. It's just - it'll just require more -	0
Yeah. Just  sort of huge.	0
you know, slightly different -	0
What's interesting is it's exactly what, um, i- in discussing with, um,  Sue  about this, um, she, um,	0
i- i- i- indicated that that -	0
you know, that's very important for [MASK]	0
Yeah. It's - it's nice to know, and also I think as a human, like, I don't always  hear  these in the actual order that they occur. So I can have two foreground speakers, you know, Morgan an- and	0
um, Adam and Jane could all be talking, and I could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time, and then look where they are  relative  to each other, and that's not really what I  heard.	0
And that's  another  thing she said. This is - This is Bever's - [MASK] when - where -	0
Cuz it's just  hard  to  do.	0
Y- Yeah. It's sort of -	0
In psy- ps- [MASK] you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a- as to what they hear, that - that -	0
Yeah, you sort of move things around until you get to a  low information point and yo- then you can bring in the other person. So it's	0
actually not even  possible,  I think, for any  person  to listen to [MASK] even equalize, and make sure that they have all the words in the right order.	0
So, I guess, we'll  try  to write this Eurospeech paper. I mean, we will  write  it. Whether they accept it  late or not, I don't know.	0
Um, and the  good  thing is that we have - It's sort of a beginning of what Don can use to link [MASK]	0
features from each file to each other.	0
Yeah. That's the good thing about these pape-	0
i- You know, might as well. We- I ju- Otherwise we won't get the work done	0
I mean, u- u-  Jane  likes to look at data. Maybe, you know, you could - you could look at this  format  and see if you find anything interesting.	0
Yeah.  No, it's - that's the good thing about these pape- paper deadlines and, uh, you know, class projects, and -  and things like that, because you - you really get g- Yeah.	0
Well, what I'm  thinking  is -	0
Well th- th- the other thing that - that - that yo- that you usually don't tell your graduate students is that these deadlines are actually not that,	0
Forces you to do the work.  Exactly.	0
um, you know, strictly enforced, because  the -	0
@@    Oh,   now  it's out in the  public,  this - this - this secret information. Yeah.	0
I think we can ha-	0
i- Because these - the  conference  organizers actually have an interest in getting lots of submissions. I mean, a - a  monetary  interest. So -	0
Th- that's - that's true.	0
And  good  ones,  good  ones, which sometimes means  a little extra time.	0
And  good  submission- Right. Well -	0
That's another issue, but -	0
By th- by the way, this is  totally  unfair, you may - you may feel, but the - the, uh - the  morning  meeting folks actually have an - an extra month or so.	0
Well, then you can just -	0
Oh, well maybe we'll submit to s-   Actually -	0
Maybe you can submit the digits paper on e- for [MASK]	0
Oh, I could! I could submit that to [MASK] That would be pretty - pretty -	0
S- That wouldn't work. It's not [MASK]	0
No, it wouldn't work. It's - it's not [MASK] - I mean, it - it's - it's actually	0
Well, maybe it won't be after this  deadline  extension. Maybe they'll -	0
But - but the people - I mean,	0
a - a paper that is  not  on [MASK] would probably be  more  interesting at that point because everybody's so sick and tired of the Aurora task.	0
Oh, I thought you meant this was just the  digits  section. I didn't know you meant it was  [MASK]	0
Well, no. If you - if you have - it's to - if you discuss some relation to [MASK] like if you use the same -	0
So they just do a little grep for -	0
Do - uh, d- d-	0
Do not - do not - we are not setting a good example. This is not a -	0
Well, a relation other than negation, maybe, um.	0
But the good thing is this does -	0
Well, I- I don't know. I mean, you could - you could do a paper on  what's wrong with [MASK] by comparing it to  other ways of doing it.	0
How well does [MASK] do on - on - you know, on digits collected in a - in this environment? Yeah.	0
I think it's a littl- little far-fetched.  Nah, I mean, the thing is [MASK] pretty closed community. I mean, you know, the people who were involved in the -	0
the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who - who made it above a certain threshold in the first round,	0
uh   w-  in ninety-nine and it's - it's sort of a - it's -	0
Well, that's maybe why they don't f-	0
know that they have a crummy system. I mean, a crummy back-end.	0
No, I mean - I mean,  seriously,  if you - if you have a very -	0
anybody - any  particular  system. I meant [MASK] If they -	0
Oh, you don't like [MASK]	0
I don't h- I don't have any stock in [MASK] or anything.	0
No. I mean, this - it- it's [MASK]  that is trained on a very limited amount of data. Yeah.	0
It's d- it's very specific.	0
But so, if you -	0
But maybe you should, you know, consider  more  - using  more  data, or - I mean -	0
Oh, yeah. I - I really think that that's  true.	0
If yo- if you sort of hermetically stay within one task and don't look left and right, then you're gonna -	0
But they - they had -	0
They had something very specific in mind when they designed it.	0
Right? And so - so you can - you can argue about maybe that wasn't the right thing to  do,  but, you know, they - they -	0
But, one of the reasons I have Chuck's messing around with - with the back-end that you're not supposed to touch -	0
I mean, for the evaluations, yes, we'll run a version that hasn't been touched.	0
But, uh, one of the reasons I  have  him messing around with that, because I think it's sort of an open question that we  don't  know the answer to. People always say very glibly	0
that i- if you s- show improvement on a bad system, that doesn't  mean  anything, cuz it may not be -	0
show - uh, because, you know, it doesn't  tell  you anything about the  good  system.	0
And I -  I've  always sort of felt that that  depends.	0
You know, that if some peopl- If you're actually are getting at something that has some  conceptual  substance  to it, it  will  port.	0
And in fact,  most  methods that people now use  were  originally tried with something that was not their absolute  best system at  some  level.	0
But of course, sometimes it doesn't,	0
uh, port. So I think that's - that's an interesting question. If we're getting  three percent error on, uh,	0
u- uh, English, uh, nati- native speakers,	0
um, using the Aurora system, and we do some  improvements  and bring it from three to  two,	0
do those same improvements bring, uh, th- you know, [MASK] from one point three to - you know, to	0
point eight? Well.  You know, so that's - that's something we can  test.	0
I think we've -  we've covered that one up extremely well.	0
Yeah. So tha- so we'll - you know, maybe you guys'll have - have one. Uh, you - you and, uh - and Dan have - have a paper that -	1
that's going in. You know, that's - that's pretty solid, on [MASK]	1
Yeah. I will send you the - the final version, which is not -	0
And [MASK] here will - will definitely get something in	1
Actually this - this, um - So, there's another paper. It's a Eurospeech paper but not related to meetings.	0
But it's on  digits.  So,	0
uh, a colleague at [MASK] developed a improved version	0
And he tested it mostly on digits because it's sort of a - you know, it doesn't take weeks to train it.	0
And got some very impressive results, um,	0
with, you know, discriminative, uh, [MASK]	0
Um, you know, like, um,	0
error rates  go from - I don't know, in very  noisy  environment, like from,	0
I for- now I - O_K, now I have the order of magnit- I'm not sure about the order of magnitude. Was it like from ten percent to	0
e- e- you know, point -	0
you know, from one percent to point eight percent? I mean, it's a -	0
H- i- it got - it got better. Yeah, yeah.	0
It got  better.  That's the important thing. Yeah. But it's -	0
Hey, that's the same percent relative, so -	0
Yeah. Right. It's, uh, something in - Right.	0
Um,  let's see. I think the only thing we had left was - unless somebody else - Well,	0
there's a  couple  things. Uh, one is  anything that, um,	0
anybody has to say about Saturday? Anything we should do in prep for Saturday?	0
I guess everybody knows about -	0
I mean, u- um, Mari was asking - was trying to come up with something like an agenda and we're sort of fitting around people's times a bit.	0
clearly when we actually get here we'll  move things around this, as we need to, but -	0
so you can't  absolutely  count on it. But - but, uh -	0
Are we meeting in  here   probably  or - ? O_K.	0
That was my thought. I think this is -	0
We won't have enough microphones, but -	0
u- No. I - I  hadn't  in- intended to. We won- we wanna - I mean, they're -	0
there's gonna be, uh, Jeff, Katrin, Mari and two students. So there's five  from there.	0
And Brian's coming, so that's  six.	0
And plus all of us.	0
Can use the Oprah mike.	0
Depends how fast you can  throw it. It's just -	0
It seems like too many - too much coming and going.	0
We don't even have enough  channel  -	0
Because it would be a different kind of meeting, that's what I'm -	0
I hadn't  really thought of it, but -	0
Maybe just - maybe not the whole day but just, you know, maybe some - I mean, part of it?	0
That's their initiation into our	0
Into our - our - our cult.	0
Yeah, our - Yeah, our -	0
Maybe the sections that are not right afte- you know, after lunch when everybody's still munching and -	0
So can you send out a schedule once you know it, jus- ?	0
O_K. Yeah. I guess I sent it around a little bit. But -	0
Is - is there a r- ? There's a res-	0
Is it  changed  now, or - ?	0
I hadn't heard back from Mari after I - I u- u-	0
uh, brought up the point abou- about Andreas's schedule. So,	0
um, maybe when I get back there'll be  some - some mail from her.	0
I'm looking forward to seeing your representation. That'd be, uh -	0
So, I'll make a -	0
And w- we should get  the two meetings from y- I mean, I know about the first meeting, um,	0
I'd like to see that. Yeah.	0
but the other one that you did, the N_S_A one, which we  hadn't done cuz we weren't [MASK] because the non-native speaker -	0
there were  five  non-native speakers.	0
But, it would be useful for the -	0
to  see  what we get  with that one. So.	0
Which N_S_A meeting was that?	0
Great. O_K. It's, uh, two thousand eleven twenty-one one thousand.	0
Oh, we did - That was the  last  one I gave you.	0
Yeah,  three.  Right. So -	0
Great. I sent email when I finished the -	0
that one. That was sort of son-	0
N_S_ A  three, I think.	0
Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's much simpler.	0
I don't know what they said but I know the number.	0
Th- that part's  definitely  gonna confuse somebody who looks at these later. I mean, this is - we- we're recording secret N_S_A meetings? I mean, it's -	0
I remember the  date.  So.	0
Um.  Not the -  Yeah.	0
Uh. The - th- the -	0
It's network services and applications.	0
They  are  hard to understand.  They're very, uh, out there. I have no idea what they're talking about.	0
th- the  other  good thing about [MASK] is that, um, it's not always the  machine's  fault if it doesn't work.  So, you can actually find, um,	1
It's the person's fault.  It's Morgan's fault.	0
problem - uh, proble-  You can find -	0
You can find, uh, problems with - with the transcripts, um, you know,	1
and go back and fix them. But -	0
Tha- There are some cases like where the - the wrong speaker - uh, these ca-	1
Not  a  lot,  but where the - the wrong person - the - the speech is addre- attached to the wrong speaker and you can tell that when you run it.	1
Or at least you can get  clues to it. So these are from the early transcriptions that people did on [MASK] like what you have.	0
I guess it  does  w-	0
It  also  raises the possibility of, um, using  that  kind of representation - I mean, I don't know, this'd be something we'd wanna check,	0
but maybe using that representation for data  entry  and then  displaying  it on [MASK] cuz it - I think that the -	0
I mean, my - my  preference  in terms of, like,  looking  at the data is to see it  in this kind of musical score format.	0
And  also,  s- you know,  Sue's  preference as  well.	0
Yeah, if you can get it to -	0
And - and -  but,  I mean, this - if this is a better interface for making these kinds of,	0
uh, you know, lo- clos- local changes, then that'd be fine, too. I don't - I have no idea. I think this is something that would need to be  checked.	0
O_K.   Th- the  other  thing  I  had actually was, I - I didn't  realize  this till  today,   but, uh, this is, uh, Jose's last  day.	0
Is my last - my last day. My -  my last  meeting   about meetings.	0
You're not gonna be here tomorrow?	0
Oh, that's right. Tomorrow -	0
Yeah. Because, eh, I leave, eh, the next Sunday. I will come back to home - to Spain.	0
Yeah. I d- so I - I jus-	0
And I - I would like to - to - to say thank you very much, eh, to all people  in the group and at ICSI, because I - I enjoyed  @@  very much, uh.	0
Yeah. It was good having you.	0
And I'm  sorry  by [MASK] because, eh,  I haven't good results, eh, yet but, eh,	0
I -  I pretend  to - to continuing out to Spain, eh,	0
during the - the following months, eh, because I have, eh, another ideas	0
but, eh, I haven't enough time to - to -  with six months it's not enough to -	0
to - to research, eh, and	0
e- i- I mean, if, eh, the topic is, eh, so difficult, uh,	0
in my opinion, there isn't -	0
Yeah. Maybe somebody else will come along and will be, uh, interested in working on it and could start off from where you are also, you know.	0
They'd make use of - of what you've  done.	0
But, eh, I - I will try to recommend, eh, at, eh,	0
the Spanish government but, eh,	0
the following  @@  scholarship, eh, eh,	0
eh, will be here   more   time,  because eh, i- in my opinion is - is better,	0
eh, for  us   to - to spend more time here	0
and to work more time i- i- in a topic.  No ?	0
Yeah, it's a very short time. Yeah.  Yeah.	0
Yeah, six months is  hard.  I think a year	0
You - e- you have, eh -	0
you are  lucky,  and you - you find a solution  in - in - in some few tim- uh, months, eh?	0
O_K. But, eh, I think it's not, eh, common.	0
But, eh, anyway, thank you. Thank you very much. Eh, I - I bring	0
the chocolate, eh, to -	0
to tear, uh, with - with you, uh.	0
I - I hope if you need, eh, something, eh, from us in the future,	0
I - I will be at Spain,	0
And, thank you very much.	0
unless somebody has something else, we'll read - read our digits and we'll get our -	0
Are we gonna do  them   simultaneously or - ?	0
get our last bit of, uh, Jose's -  Jose   - Jose's digit - Uh, I'm sorry?	0
Ye- ye- you prefer, eh, to eat, eh, chocolate, eh, at the coffee break, eh, at the - ?	0
Or you prefer  now,  before after - ?	0
Well, we have a time -	0
No, we prefer to keep it for ourselves.	0
Well, we have a s- a time -  time  constraint. Yeah.	0
So keep it away from that end of the table.	0
Why is it that I can read your mind?	0
Well, we've gotta wait until after di- after we take the mikes off.	0
So are we gonna do digits simultaneously or what?	0
You - This is our reward if we  do our digi-	0
I - I think, eh, it's enough, eh, for more peopl- for more people  after. But, eh -	0
We're gonna - we're gonna do digits at the same -	0
I'm going to get a ticket if people don't eat some.	0
So, I have a vested interest.	0
To Andreas, the idea is - is good.  s- To eat here.	0
Tha- that's - that looks  great.  Alright, so in the interest of getting to the -	0
Oh, yeah. Th- it doesn't - it won't leave this room.	0
We could do digits while other people eat. So it's background crunching.	0
Is, eh, a - another acoustic event.	0
We don't have background chewing.	0
No, we don't have any data with background eating.	0
She's - she's serious.  She is serious.	0
It's just the  rest  of the digits - the rest of the digits are very  clean,	0
Are you - ?  Oh,  they're  clean.	0
um, without a lot of background noise, so I'm just not sure -	0
You have to write down, like, while y- what you're - what ch- chocolate you're eating cuz they might make different sounds, like n- nuts - chocolate with nuts, chocolate without nuts.	0
Actually -  actually kind of careful cuz I have a strong allergy to nuts, so I have to sort of figure out one without th-	0
That w- Oh,  yeah,  they - they might.	0
It's hard to - hard to say.	0
Maybe  those?  They're so -	0
I don't know.  Um -	0
This is - You know, this is a different kind of speech, looking at chocolates, deciding - you know, it's another  style.	0
Yeah. I may - I may hold off. But if I was - eh, but maybe I'll get some later.	0
Thanks. Well - well, why don't we - ? He - he's worried about a  ticket.  Why don't we do a simultaneous one?	0
Remember to read the transcript number, please.	0
And you laughed at me, too, f- the first time I said that.	0
You laughed at me, too, the first time I sa- said -	0
I did, and now I love it so much.	0
You really shouldn't, uh, te-	0
You have to sort of, um - Jose, if you haven't done this, you have to plug your ears while you're t- talking so that you don't get confused, I guess.	0
W- wait - wait a minute - wait a minute.	0
W- we want - we want -	0
Hey,  you've  done this before. Haven't you?	0
Yeah. Oh, you've done this one before? Together?	0
You've read  digits together with us, haven't you - I mean, at the same time?	0
Oh, you haven't! Oh, O_K.	0
I'm not - we - we - Oh, and you haven't done this either. I- the first time is  traumatic, but -	0
Oh, and [MASK]  are important, so yo- you're supposed to pause betw	0
Yeah. O_K. So, uh -	0
You mean that the - [MASK]	0
That'd be good. We- we'll give everybody the same sheet but they say different -	0
It's like a - like a Greek - like a Greek choir? You know? Like -  Yeah.	0
Hey, what a good idea. We could do the same sheet for everyone. Have  them   all read  them   at once.	0
Or - or just same digits. See if anyone notices.	0
So they would all be - Yeah.	0
Yeah. That'd be good. And then - then we can  sing  them next time.	0
There's  so  many possibilities.  Uh. O_K, why don't we go?	0
Uh, one two three - Go!	0
Did you read it twice or what?	0
And Andreas has the last word.	0
He's try- No, he's trying to get good recognition performance.	0
He had the - the long form.	0
