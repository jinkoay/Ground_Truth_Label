Mental - mental Palm Pilot.	0
So. What? I'm supposed to be on channel  five?	0
Her . Nope.  Doesn't seem to be, yeah.	0
What does your thing say on the back?	0
See, that matches the  seat  up  there.  So.	0
Yeah, well, I g-  guess   it's coming up then, or -	0
That starts counting from zero and these start counting from one.	0
Ergo, the classic off-by-one error.	0
Your  mike   number  is what we're t-	0
I've  bested  you  again,  Nancy.	0
No,  but the  paper's  correct.	0
I didn't det- I was  saying  the  microphone,   not  the  paper.	0
Yes, you've  bested  me again.  That's how I think of our continuing interaction.  Damn! Foiled  again!	0
So is Keith showing up? He's talking with George right now. Uh, is he gonna get a rip - uh - rip himself away from -	0
probably  not,  is my guess.	0
Oh,  then it's just gonna be the  five  of us?	0
Well, he - he was very affirmative in his way of saying he will be here at four. But  you know, that was before he knew about that George lecture probably.	0
This - this is  not  -	0
It's not bad for the project if Keith is talking to George.	0
O_K. So my suggestion is we just	0
Well,  I  sort of had  informal  talks with	0
most  of you. So, Eva just reported she's really happy about [MASK] being in the same order in the X_M_L as in the	0
um - be- Java declaration format so you don't have to	0
do too much in the style sheet	0
The - uh, Java - [MASK]  wants to take input - uh, uh,	1
Eva is using [MASK] to conv	1
for the - into the, uh, [MASK]	1
Actually, maybe I could try, like,  emailing  the guy and see if he has any- something already.	1
he has both [MASK] in -	0
But that's some sort of conversion program?	0
And put them into different  formats.	0
Oh - Yep, he could do that, too.	0
I think you should demand things from him.	0
He charges so much. Right.	0
No, I think it's a good idea that you may as well  ask.   Sure.	0
And, um, well  pretty mu- pretty much on t- on the  top  of my list, I would have asked Keith how the "where is X_?"  hand parse is standing.	0
Um.  But we'll skip that.	0
Uh, there's good news from Johno. The generation templates are done.	1
So the trees  for -	0
the X_M_L trees for the - for the gene- for the synthesizer	1
are written. So I just need to  do the, uh - write a new set of  tree combining rules.  But	1
I think those'll be pretty similar to the old ones.	1
Just gonna be - you know -	0
You  were gonna send  me  a note	0
I didn't finish the  sentence  but he  understood  it.	0
I  know what he's talking about.	0
We - w- um -	0
not a - just a surface string that is fed into a text-to-speech	1
but, [MASK] that's fed int	1
Now and [MASK] has  certain rules on how  if you get the following syntactic	1
structure, how to map this onto  [MASK]	1
And  Fey  has foolheartedly agreed to  rewrite	1
uh, the  German  concept- uh  [MASK] -	1
I didn't know she spoke German.	0
No, she  doesn't.   But she speaks  English.	0
Oh. Rewrite the German ones into English. O_K, got it.	0
if it's O_K that we give her a couple of more hours per week, then  she'll do that.	0
What   language  is that  written i- Is that [MASK] that you showed me?	0
She knows how to program in [MASK]  I hope?	0
My  guess is - I - I asked for a commented version of that file?	0
If we get that, then it's  doable, even without getting into it, even though [MASK] is really well docu	0
Well, I guess if you're not used to functional programming, [MASK] can be completely incomprehensible.	1
Like  there's lots of unnamed functions and -  You know?	0
Anyway, it - We'll sort this out. Um.	0
But anyway, send me the note and then I'll- I'll check with, uh, Morgan on the money. I - I don't anticipate any problem but we have to  ask.	0
Oh, so this was -	0
You know, on the  generation  thing,	0
sh- y- she's really going to  do  that, then we should be able to get [MASK] as  well.  So it'll say it's nonsense with	0
Are we gonna - Can we change the voice	0
of the - of the thing, because right now the voice sounds like a murderer.	0
Yep. We ha- we  have  to change the voice.	1
The - the little Smarticus - Smarticus sounds like a murderer.	0
But I will  not  give them to you unless you come into my lair.	0
It is - Uh, we have the choice between the, uh, usual [MASK] which I already t	1
It's the name of some  program,   the - the  synthesizer.	0
Oh, oh. Got it. O_K.	0
You know, the usual party voices.	0
Yeah, I know.  That doesn't sound,  exactly right either.	0
[MASK] has, uh, crafted a couple	1
type voices that are really nice and we're going to use  that. We can still, um, d- agree on a  gender,  if we want.	1
So we still have male or female.	0
Well, let's just pick whatever sounds best.	0
Does [MASK] stand for - ?	0
Unfortunately, probably male voices, a bit more research on. So.	0
It turns out there's the  long-standing  links with these guys in the speech group.	0
In fact, there's this guy who's basically got a joint appointment,  Hynek  Hermansky.	0
He's- spends a fair amount of time here.  Anyway.	0
Leave it.  Won't be a problem.	0
O_K.  And it's probably also absolutely uninteresting for all of you to, um	1
learn that as of twenty minutes ago, David and I, per accident, uh managed to get	1
[MASK] running on the - uh, ICSI Linux machines with	1
thereby increasing the number of [MASK] in this house from  one on my laptop to  three.	0
How was this by accident?	0
Yeah, I know. Tha- that's the part I didn't understand.	0
Um, I suggested to try something that was really kind of - even though against better knowledge shouldn't have worked, but it worked.	0
Intuition.  Maybe - maybe - maybe a bit for [MASK]	0
Will it work  again,  or - ?	0
And, um, we'll never found out why.	0
It- it's just like why - why the generation ma- the presentation manager is now working?	0
This is something you ha- you get used to as a programmer, right? You know,  and it's cool, it works out  that way .	0
the - the people at Saarbruecken and I decided not to touch it ever again.	0
Yeah, that would work .	0
Um - I was gonna ask you where something is	0
and what we know about that.	0
Where [MASK] is.	0
What - what thing is this?	0
Oh, but by - Uh, we can ask, uh, did you get to read all four hundred words?  Was it O_K? Was it?	0
I - I wa- I was  looking  at it. It doesn't follow  logically.	0
It doesn't - The first paragraph doesn't seem to have any link to the second paragraph.	0
You know, i- Yeah, it -	0
Each  paragraph is good, though. I li-	0
I- i- Yeah. Well, it- it's fine.	0
It was written by committee.	0
But c- the  meeting  looks like it's, it's gonna be good.	0
I think it's uh -	0
Yeah, I didn't know about it until  Robert told me, like,	0
Yeah, I - I ra- I ran across it in - I don't even know  where,  you know - some just - some weird	0
And, uh, yeah, I- I'm surprised I  didn't  know about it	0
Y- yeah. Well, yeah. I was like, why didn't  Dan  tell me?	0
since we know all the invited speakers, an-	0
So - But anyway, yeah.	0
I- so I - I  did  see that.	0
Oh wha- Yeah. Before we get started on this st-  so I also had a nice email correspondence with Daphne Kohler, who said yes indeed she would love to work with us on the, um, - you know, using [MASK] and stuff	1
but  starting in August, that she's also got a new student working on this and that we should get in touch with them again in August and then we'll figure out a way for you - uh - you to get seriously connected with, um	1
Yeah, I'll say it now. So, um -	0
And it looks to me like	1
we're now at a good point to do something - start working on something really  hard.	1
We've been so far working on things that are easy.	0
[MASK] and uh -	1
It's a hard puzzle.  But  the other  part  of it is the way they connect to	1
these, uh, [MASK]	1
So  there's  all  the problems that the  linguists  know about, about [MASK] and the  cognitive  linguists know about, but then there's this problem of the	1
[MASK]  people have only done a  moderately  good job of dealing with	1
Uh, which they call dynamic -	0
they  incorrectly  call  [MASK] So there'	0
one of the things I w- would  like  to do over the next, uh, month, it may take more,  is to st- understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them	1
uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be, but also what that would translate into in terms of [MASK] and the  inferences.	1
So the  story  is that if you  have  these [MASK]  they're set up, in  principle,  so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other, and all that sort of stuff, so it  should  be feasible	0
to set them up in such a way that if you've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate  uh,  [MASK]	0
that they do their inferences with  just  the couplings that	0
But that's g- that's, as far as I can tell, it's - it's putting together two  real  hard problems. One is	1
what  are  the couplings and - and when you have a certain, uh, construction, that implies certain couplings and other couplings, you know, between let's say between the past and the present, or any other one of these things	1
and then we have this  inference  problem of exactly technically how does [MASK]  work	1
um, let's say one in - in, you know, different tenses or my beliefs and  your  beliefs, or any of these other ones of - of multiple models. So	0
you know, in the long run we need to solve  both  of those and my suggestion is that we	0
them both, uh, in a way we- that, you know, th-  hopefully  turns out to be consistent, so that the -	0
And  sometimes  it's actually  easier	0
to solve two hard problems than  one  because they  constrain  each other. I mean if you've got huge ra- huge range of possible choices	0
We'll  see.  But  anyway,  so that's, um -	0
Oh yeah, like uh, I solved the - the problem of um - we were talking about how do you -	0
various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote "count as a noun phrase", you know, occur as [MASK] bu	0
and it would take a really long time to explain it now, but I'm about to write it up this evening.	0
I solved that at the same time as "how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase" to get something like "I the kicked dog". Um.	0
Did it - did it at once. So maybe - maybe it'll be a similar thing.	0
No, I know, I th- I- I think that  is  gonna be	1
the  key  to this wh- to th- the  big  project of the summer of - of getting the  constructions  right is that	1
people  do  manage to do this so there probably are some, uh, relatively clean  rules,  they're just not [MASK]	1
And if we - if the formalism is - is  good,  then we should be able to	0
have, you know, sort of  moderate  scale thing. And that by the way is - is, Keith, what I encouraged George to be	0
talking with you about.  Not  the formalism yet	0
The p-  And - Oh,  another  thing, um	0
thing that  Nancy  agreed to in a - in a weak moment this morning	0
Uh, sorry. In a - in a friendly moment.	0
Anyway, uh, that we were - that we're gonna try to get a	1
uh, [MASK] by the end of next week.	1
O_K? Probably  skipping  [MASK]	0
Uh, just trying to write up essentially what - what you guys have worked out	1
so that everybody has something to look at. We've  talked  about it, but only the innermost inner group	1
Yeah, and - and not even all of them really do. But like -	0
There's - The group as a  whole  knows but no individual member kno-	0
Well that that - yeah th- there's one of the advantages of a document, right?, is - is that	0
it actually transfers from head to head.	0
So anyway. So um -	0
Communication, documentation and stuff.   Anyway,  so, uh, with a little luck -	0
Uh - l- let's, let's have that as a goal anyway.	0
So, uh, what was the date there? Monday or - ?	0
No, w- uh - we're talking about a week fr- e- end of next week.	0
But, uh, but - but the  two  of us will probably talk to you at well before th- I mean.	0
End  of next week. I thought you said beginning  of n-	0
Anyway, w- let's talk separately about how t-	0
Yeah, I have a busy weekend but after that -	0
O_K. Yeah, so - so someti- sometime next week.	0
Now if it turns out that that effort leads us into	0
You know, if you say we're - we're  dump - dump - dump .	0
There's a  really  hard problem we haven't solved yet - that, that's just fine.	0
But at - at least sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now.	0
Right, t- t- if - to the extent that we  have  it, let's  write  it	0
and to the extent we  don't,  let's find out what we need to  do.	0
Is it worth  thinking of an example out of our	0
tourism thing domain, that involves a - a - [MASK]  or setting up -	0
I think it is, but - uh - but I interrupted before Keith got to tell us what happened with	1
"where is the Powder-Tower?" or whatever	1
Uh, what was  supposed  to happen? I've sort of been actually caught up in some  other  ones, so, um, you know, I don't have a write-up of -	0
or I haven't elaborated on the ideas that we were already talking about which were -	0
Hmm, yeah. I think - I think we already  came	0
to the conclusion that we have two alternative  paths that we -	0
two alternative ways of representing it. One is sort of a - has a	0
The question of [MASK]	1
One of them was th-	0
or comes - is resolved	0
I think it has to be the - the second case.	0
Um, so d'you - Is it clear what we're talking about here?	0
The question is [MASK] between asking for location and asking for path. Um	1
So you might be - yeah, y-	1
Should we have a - a - a -	0
or - or whether the construction semantically, uh, is clearly only asking for location but pragmatically that's construed as meaning "tell me how to get there".	1
So  assume these are two, uh, nodes we can observe in [MASK] So these are either	0
true or false and it's also just true  or false.	0
If we encounter a phrase such as "where is X_?", should that set  this  to true  and  this to true, and [MASK] figures out which under the c- situation in general is more  likely?	0
Um, or should it just activate	0
this,  have this be  false,  and [MASK] figures out whether this  actually  now means - ?	0
Uh w- that's a s- O_K, so that's a - that's a  separate  issue. So I a- I I th- I agree with you that, um, it's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every	1
[MASK] although there are  some  that will need to  be  there.	1
I mean, there- there's some that -	0
Or have every construction list all the possible [MASK] of the same one.  Right.	0
You can't do that either. Yeah.	0
But, you know, c- um - almost certainly "can you pass the salt" is a construction worth	0
noting that there is this th- this - this - this - uh	0
So right, this one is maybe in the gray area. Is it - is it like  that  or is it just sort of	0
obvious from world knowledge that no one - you wouldn't want to know the location without wanting to know how to get there or whatever.	0
Or in some cases, it's - it's quite  definitely  s- so that you  just  know - wanna know	0
Well the question is basically, is this conventional or conversational implicature?	1
And I guess, see, the more  important  thing at  this  stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it in ei-	0
f- in the  short  run it's more important to know	1
how we would treat -	1
technically what we would do if we decided A_ and what we would do if we decided B_, than it is t- to decide A_ or B_ r-	1
Which of that is.  Yeah, O_K	0
Cuz there will be other k- examples that are one way or the other. Right.	0
W- we know for  sure  that we have to be able to do  both.  So I guess	1
In the  short  run, let's - let's	0
be  real  clear on h-	0
what the two alternatives would  be.	0
And then the-  we had another idea floating around	0
um, which we wanted to, uh, get your input on, and that concerns the -	0
But the  nice  thing is w- we  would  have a person that would like to  work  on it, and that's Ir- Irina  Gurevich   from [MASK]  who is going to be visiting us, uh, the week before, uh, August	1
and a little bit into August.	0
And she would like to  apply [MASK] that is, um	1
being crafted at [MASK] That's not the one I sent you. The one I sent you was fr	1
Um, and one of the reas- one of the - those ideas was,	0
back to the old Johno observation that if y- if you have a dialogue history  and it said	1
the word " admission  fee"	1
um, it's more likely that the person actually wants to  enter   than just take a picture of it	1
Now what  could  imagine - to, you know, have a list for each construction of things that one should look up in the discourse history, yeah? That's the  really  stupid way.	0
Then there is the  really  clever  way that was suggested by  Keith   and then there is the, uh,  middle  way that  I'm  suggesting  and that is you - you  get   X_ , which is whatever, the castle.	1
[MASK] will tell us that castles have opening hours, that they have admission fees, they have whatever.	1
And then, this is - We go via a thesaurus	0
and look up  certain linguistic surface structures  that are related to these concepts  and feed  those  through the dialogue history and check dynamically	1
for each e- entity. We look it up	1
check whether any of these were mentioned	1
and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse	1
But Keith suggested that a - a much cleaner way would be -  is,   you know, to keep track of the discourse in such a way that you - if you  know  that something like that ha- has been mentioned  before,  this just a- continues to add up, you know, in th- in a -	1
So if someone mentions admission f- fees, that activates [MASK] which sticks around for a little while in your rep- in the representation of what's being talked about. And then when someone asks "where is X_?" you've already got the -	0
Yeah. So that's certainly  more  realistic. I m- I mean  psychologically.  Now  technically	0
Well, uh, is it - doesn't it seem like if you just managed the dialogue history with a - a thread, that	0
you know, kept track of ho- of the activity of -	0
I mean, cuz it would - the - the thread would know what nodes  like, needed to be activated, so it could just keep track of  how long it's been since  something's been mentioned, and  automatically load it in.	0
You  could  do that. Um.	0
here's - here's a way - in th- in the bl-  [MASK]  you could - you could  think  about it this way, that if	1
um  at the time "admissions fee" was mentioned  you could increase the probability  that someone wanted to  enter.	1
We- yeah - th- th- that's what I wa- I wasn't - I was -	0
I wasn't thinking in terms of [MASK] I was just -	0
Fair enough, O_K, but, but, in terms of the c- c- the current implementation - right?	0
It would already be higher in the  context.	0
th- that th- the - the - the conditional probability that someone -	0
So at the time you  mentioned  it -	0
This is - this is essentially [MASK] equivalent	0
of [MASK] It's -	0
In some ways it's not as good but it's  the implementation we  got.  We don't  have  [MASK]	0
Yeah, sure. No, I mean	0
Now my  guess  is that it's  not  a question of time but it	0
is a question of whether another  intervening object has been  mentioned.	0
I mean, we could look at dialo- this is - Of course the  other  thing we ha- we do is, is we have this data coming	0
which probably will blow all our theories, but -  but skipping that - so - so - but my guess is what - what'll  probably  will happen,	1
Here's a - here's a proposed design.	1
is that there're certain constructions which, uh, for our purposes do	1
change [MASK] and various other kinds	1
the, uh,  standard  way that - that the- these contexts work is sort of stack-like or whatever, but that's sort of the most recent  thing.	1
And so it  could  be that  when another	1
uh, en- tourist entity gets mentioned, you	1
re- re- essentially re-initiali- you know, re-i- essentially re-initialize the  state.	1
And of course i- if we had a  fancier  one with multiple worlds	1
you could have - uh, you could keep track of what	1
saying about this and that. You know, "I wanna go - in the morning I wanna -"	1
"Here's my plan for today. Here's my plan for tomorrow." hypothetically.	0
Yeah, or - Yeah, in the morning morning I- I'm planning t- to go shopping, in the afternoon to the Powder-Tower -	0
Uh, tal- so I'm talking about  shopping  and then you say, uh, you know, well, um	0
"What's it cost?" or something. Or -  Anyway.  So one could well imagine, but not  yet.	0
But I  do  th- think that the -	0
It'll turn out that it's gonna be - depend pretty much on whether there's been an override.	0
Yeah, I mean, if - if you ask "how much does a train ride and - and cinema around the vineyards cost?" and then somebody tells you it's sixty dollars and then you say	0
How much is, uh - I would like to  visit the -"  whatever, something completely different, "then I go to, you know, Point Reyes",	0
it - it's  not  more likely that you want to enter  anything,  but it's, as a matter of fact, a complete  rejection  of entering	0
So when you admit- have admission fee and it changes something, it's only for that particular - It's relational, right? It's only for that particular object.	0
Yeah, I th- th- Yeah.	0
Well, and - and - and the  simple  idea is that it's on- it's only for m- for the current	0
uh, tourist e- entity of  instre-   interest.	0
I mean this - this function,	0
so, has the current object been mentioned in -	0
in - with a question about -	0
No, no. It's - it -	0
It goes the other d- it goes in the other direction.	0
When th- When the - this is  mentioned,   the	0
probability of - of, let's say, entering changes-	0
For - But - Right.	0
You could just hav- uh, just basically, ob- it -	0
It observes an - er, it sets the - a node for	0
"entered" or "true" or something, "discourse enter".	0
Now, uh - But I think Ro- Robert's  right,  that to  determine  that,	1
O_K? you may well want to go through a th- thesaurus and - and -	1
So, if the issue is, if - so now th- this construction has been matched and you say "O_K.	1
Does  this actually  have  any  implications  for our  decisions? "	1
Then there's another piece of code	1
that presumably   does  that  computation.	1
So, sort of [MASK] in a way, rather than  backward. O_K.	0
But - but what's  Robert's  saying is - is,	0
and I think he's  right,	0
is you  don't  want to try to build into the construction  itself	0
all the synonyms and all - you know, all the wo-	0
I'll have to  think  about  that.	0
I mean it - th-	1
I can thi- I can think of arguments in either direction on that.  But  somehow  you want to do it.	1
Well, it's just another, sort of, construction side is how to get at the possible inferences we can draw from the discourse history	0
or changing of the  probabilities, and-or -	0
Guess it's like - I g- The other thing is, whether you have a m-	0
that has, you know, whatever, a current plan,	0
plans that had been discussed, and	0
I don't know, I mean -	0
What - uh, what's the argument for putting it  in  the construction? Is it just that  the s- synonym selection is better, or - ?	1
Well, the ar- the - The argument is that	0
you're gonna have the -	0
If you've recognized the word,	0
you've recognized the  word,  which means you have [MASK] for it, so you could just as well tag	1
[MASK] with the fact that it's a	1
uh, you know, thirty percent increase in	1
You - So you could - you could - you could invert -  invert  the whole thing, so you s- you tag  that  information on to  the lexicon since you	0
had to recognize it  anyway.	0
That  - that's the argument in the other direction.	0
Yeah, and this is -	0
Even though uh [MASK]	0
[MASK] itself - out - out of context,	0
uh, won't  do  it. I mean, y- you have to keep track whether the person says	0
"But I- but I'm  not  interested in the opening times"	0
is sort of a- more [MASK]	0
Yeah there's, yeah ther- there's that as well.	0
uh, we have time to -	0
just a sidetrack, but uh	0
I think it's also something that people have not done before, is	1
um, sort of abuse [MASK] for these kinds of, uh, inferences, on	1
whether anything relevant to the current something has been -	1
uh, has crept up in the dialogue history already, or not.	1
I have the, uh -	1
If we  wanted  to have that  function  in the dialogue hi- [MASK] I have the written consent of   Jan   to put it in there.	1
Well, this - this is highly relevant to someone's thesis.	0
That's - uh, I'm - I'm	0
keeping on good terms with   Jan.   Yeah.	0
So the point is, it's  very  likely that Robert's thesis is going to be along these lines, and the local rules are	1
if it's  your  thesis,  you  get to decide how it's done.	1
O_K. So if, you know - if this is -  seriously,  if this becomes part of  your  thesis, you can say, hey we're gonna do it  this  way, that's the way it's done.	0
Yay, it's not  me.   It's always  me  when it's someone's thesis.	0
No,  no, no! No, no. We've got a lot - we've got a  lot  of theses going.	0
Now it's not. Yay!  I know it is.  It's  so  nice!	0
There's a  few  of us around now.	0
Well, let's - let's talk after Friday the twenty-ninth.	0
Then we'll see how f- f-	0
Right. So h- he's got a th- he's got a meet- meeting in Germany with his thesis advisor.	0
Yeah, he said he's gonna f- finish his thesis by then.	0
I should try to finish it by then. Yeah. So.	0
Yeah. So I think  in fact,	0
That's the other thing.  uh, this is - this is,	1
speaking of hard problems,  this is a  very  good time	1
um, to start trying to make explicit where [MASK] comes in and - you know, where c- where the construction	1
ends   and where [MASK] comes in, cuz this is  clearly   part  of th- Huh?	1
Yeah, we've - we've done  quite  a bit of that.  We've been doing quite a bit of that.	0
Well I  said.  But that's part of what the f-	0
We have many jobs for you, Ro- Robert.  The conclusion.	0
Yeah, it seems to always land in your category. You're lucky.	0
Well, he's gonna  need  this.	0
Right. So.  Right. So thing - That's part of why we want the formalism, is - is because th- it is gonna have implicit  in  it	1
Was I? In the room?	0
No, you  weren't  there  on  purpose.  Like -	0
Made it much easier to make these decisions. Uh.	0
Right. Well I - That's  tentative.  They aren't decisions, they're ju- they're just  proposals.	0
Yeah, that -  That's  the point, is - is th-	0
Constraints.  Let's call them constraints, around which one has to -	0
Actually, yeah.  There's a problem with that word, too, though.	0
Yeah.   Anyway. But so that's that's w-	0
Yeah, but it - he- the decisions I made wer- had to do with my  thesis.  So consequently don't I get to decide then that it's Robert's job?	0
Well, I'll just pick a piece of the problem and then just  push  the hard stuff into the center  and say it's Robert's. Like.	0
I've always been  completely in favor of consensus decisions, so we'll - we'll find a way.	0
Well, we - we - we will, but um	0
It - it might even be  interesting then to  say that I should be forced to	0
um, sort of pull some of the ideas that have been floating in my head out of the, uh - out of the top hat	0
That metaphor is not going anywhere, you know.	0
Ri- No. Absolutely. So, uh, wh- you had - you know you ha- You had done one draft.	0
Yes, and, um, it's -	0
Ha-  None  of that is basically still around, but it's -	0
Oh, I guess it's good I didn't read it.	0
I - this is - I'm  shocked.  This is the  first  time I've seen a thesis proposal  change.	0
Right.  Anyway,  uh.  So. But, yeah, a second - that would be  great.  So, uh, a sec- I mean you're gonna need it anyway.	0
Yeah, and I would like to d- discuss it and, you know, get you guys's input and make it sort of bomb-proof.	0
That's  the word I was looking for.	0
So that, so th- thi- this - I mean, so this is the point, is we - we're going to have to cycle through this, but	0
th- the draft of the p- proposal on the  constructions  is - is going to tell us a  lot  about  what  we think needs to be done by  [MASK]	0
And, um, we oughta be  doing  it.	0
Yeah, we need - we need some - Then we need to make some dates.	1
Meeting - regular meeting time for the summer, we really haven't found one. We did  Thursdays  one  for a while.	1
I just talked to Ami. It's- it's a coincidence that he  can't  do -  couldn't  do it today  here.	0
Usually he has no real constraints. So -	0
And [MASK] moved to  Wednesday,  cuz of - of, uh	0
Yeah, it was just an  exception.	0
Yeah, you weren't here, but - but - but - s- uh, - And so, if that's O_K with you, you would -	0
It's i- Is it staying basically at the Wednesday noon?	0
Yeah. I always thought it was staying.	0
O_K. It was th- off this week, yeah.	0
Yeah, I thought it was just this week that we were changing it.	0
And, um. How do we feel about doing it Wednesdays? Because it seems to me that this is sort of a time where when we  have things to discuss with  other  people, there - they seem to be s- tons of people around.	0
The only disadvantage  is that it may interfere with other	0
s- you know, other - other - No, you - Uh, people in  this  group connecting with - with	0
Those people who  happen to be around.	0
those people  who - who might not be around so  much.  Uh,  I  don't care. I- I- uh	0
I have no fixed -	0
To tell you the truth, I'd rath- I'd, I'd - would like to avoid more than one I_C_S_I meeting per day, if possible.  But -  I mean. I don't know. Whatever.	0
No, that's  fine.  I mean that -	0
The - I'd like to have them all in one day, so  package   them   up and then -	0
Yeah, I can understand that.	0
people - people differ in their tastes in this matter. I - I'm neutral.	0
Yeah.  I'm always here anyway, so -	0
Yeah.  @@  That's - Me  too.  I'm basically - I'm here. So.	0
Well, if - one  sort of thing is, this room is taken at - after three-thirty pr- pretty much every day	0
by the data collection. So we have subjects  anyway  - Except for this week, we have subjects in here. That's why it was  one.	0
So we just knew i-	0
So did you just say that Ami can't make one o'clock?	0
So let's say Thursday one. But for next week, this is a bit	1
So  I would suggest that we need to - to talk -	0
O_K. About the c- the - th-	0
Could we do Thursday at one-thirty? Would that -	0
Because, uh, this room is again taken at two-thirty by Morgan.	0
Oh, O_K. O_K. You didn't tell me that. O_K, that's fine.	0
the - s- meeting recorder meeting meeting meeting recording on meeting meetings -	0
Interesting.   So you're proposing that we meet  Tuesday.	0
Well,  we're  meeting Tuesday. I mean we  usually  meet Tuesday - or l- like, linguists  um, at  two.	0
Do you want to meet again here bef-	0
Is [MASK] still at - on Tuesdays?	0
Well, actually we- w- we- we  did  scrap our  Monday  time just because  Bhaskara  couldn't	0
Hhh.  Maybe I  do  need a Palm Pilot.	0
come Monday. So there's -  Nothing's  impeding  Monday  anymore   either.	0
That doesn't apply to a -	0
Get a fresh start -	0
Although I thought you wanted to go  camping  on Monday - er, take off Mondays a lot so you could go  camping.	0
Yeah, that's another s- thing. Yeah.	0
But, um. I mean, there are also usually then holidays anyways.	0
Sometimes   it works out that way.	0
Well, I mean, the  linguists'  meeting  i- happens to be at two, but I think that's - I mean.	0
That should be relatively flexible be-	0
- pretty flexible, I think. So.	0
Yeah. There's just  sort of the	0
two to four of us. Right? Yeah. So.	0
And, you know, of course Nancy and I are just sort of always talking  anyway  and sometimes we do it in that room. So, you know, I mean.	0
O_K, so  l- forget about the b- the camping thing. So let's - eh, any  other  problems w- w- w- ?	0
But,  I  suggested Monday. If that's a problem for me then I shouldn't   suggest  it.	0
Um, all of the proposed times sound fine with me.	0
O_K, whate- I mean -	0
What I think Robert's saying is that	0
earlier we - At least for next week, there's a lot of stuff we want to get done, so why don't we plan to meet Monday and  we'll see if we want to meet any more than that.	1
At o- o- o- o- one, two, three - ?	0
Oh, I i-  Yeah,  I  actually -  Two  is the earliest I can meet on Monday.	0
Here I'm  blissfully  agreeing to things and realizing that I actually  do  have some stuff scheduled on Monday.	0
Uh, so that's the eighteenth.	1
You guys will still remind me, right?	0
Y- you'll come and take all the -  the headph- the good headphones first and  then  remind me.	0
W- why do you - ?	0
Why do I have this unless I'm gonna  write ? Fine.	0
do I get to see th- uh, your formalism before  that?	0
Uh. Would you like to?	0
O_K. I was actually gonna work on it for tomorrow - like this - this weekend.	0
I wo- I would like - I would sort of  get a - get a  notion  of what - what you guys have in store for me.	0
Well m-  @@  you know, w- maybe Mond- Maybe we can put - This is part of what we can do Monday, if we want.	0
I mean, I - I - I -	0
Is some - some version	0
Yeah,  so there was like, you know, m- m- in my head the goal to have like an intermediate version, like, everything  I  know.	0
And then, w- I would talk to  you  and figure out everything  you  know, that - you know, see if they're consistent.	0
Why don't w- Maybe you and I should meet sort of more or less first thing Monday morning and then we can work on this.	0
That's f- fine with me. So.	0
I might - I might - um, s- You said you're busy  over th- until the weekend, right?	0
Yeah, sort of through the weekend because Kate has a photography show.	0
That's fine. So we  might  continue our email	0
thing and that might be fine, too. So, maybe I'll send you some -	0
Um, if you have time after this I'll show you the noun phrase thing.	0
O_K. That would be cool. So.	0
So the idea is on Monday at two we'll -	1
we'll see an intermediate version of the formalism for the constructions, and do an on-line merging with my [MASK]	1
So that's O_K for you -	0
So it won't be, like, a for- semi-formal presentation of my  proposal. It'll be more like towards  finalizing that proposal. O_K, that's fine.	0
Cuz then you'll find out more of what we're making you do.	0
We'll make a presentation of your propo-  of your proposal.	0
Perfect.  Can you also write it up?	0
It's like, "this is what we're doing. And the complement is Robert."	0
I'll - I'll send you -	0
I'll - I'll send you a style file, right? You just -	0
I already sent you my fi-  my bib file. So.	0
Someday we also have to - we should probably talk about the other side of [MASK] which is the issue of, um, how do you simulate questions? What d	1
Because  it's a little different. We had to - we had an idea for this which seemed like it would  probably  work.	0
Yeah, now, we- we w-	0
Great. O_K. Yeah. [MASK] may need - we may n- need to re-name that.	0
I - Yeah. I -	0
O_K? So let's think of a name for - for whatever the - this intermediate structure is. Oh, we talked about  [MASK]	1
You know, so it's a m- minimal change.	0
Only have to change one vowel. That's great. All the old like  graphs, just change the - just, like, mark out the -	0
Right, a little substi- substi- You know, that's what text  substitution	0
Yeah. It's  good  for you.	0
uh macros are for. Anyway, uh, so let's - let's for the  moment  call it that until we think of something better.	0
And, yeah, we absolutely need to find -	0
Part  of what was  missing  were markings of all  sorts  that weren't in there, incl- including the questions - We didn't - we never did figure out how we were gonna do emphasis	1
Yeah, we've talked a little bit about  that, too, which -	0
uh, uh, it's hard for me to figure out with  sort of  our general linguistic issues, how they map onto this particular one, but -	0
But that's part of the formalism - is got to be	0
uh, how things like that get marked.	0
W- do you have data, like the - the -	0
You have preliminary  data? Cuz I know, you know, we've been using this one easy sentence	0
and I'm sure you guys have - uh, maybe you are the one who've been looking at  the rest of it - it'd - it'd be useful for me, if we want to  have it a little bit more	0
To tell you the truth, what I've been looking at has not been the data so far, I just sort of said "alright let's see if I can get noun phrases and, uh, major verb co- uh, constructions out of the way first."	0
And I have  not  gotten them out of the way yet. Surprise. So, um.	0
So, I have not really approached a lot of the data, but I mean obviously like these - the - the question one, since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that, you know, I ca- can try and, um	1
run with  that,  you know, try and do some of [MASK] now. It would make sense.	1
O_K. Do you wanna run the indefinite pronoun idea past Jerry?	1
Oh yeah, the basic idea is that um,	0
uh  you know - Uh,  let's see  if I can  formulate this.	0
So  Mary fixed the car with a wrench.	0
So you  perform [MASK]  and then, you know, " who  fixed the car with a wrench?"	1
You  basically are told, to - to do this	0
In the - in - analogously to the way you would do " someone  fixed the car with a wrench". And then you hand it back to your hippocampus and find out  what that, you know,	1
means, and then  come up with that - so  who  that someone was.	0
The W_H question has this as sort of extra thing which says "and when you're done, tell me who fills that slot" or w- you know. So, um.	1
And, you know, this is sort of a nice way to do it, the idea of sort of saying that you treat - from the simulation point of view or whatever - you treat, uh, [MASK] similarly to	1
uh, indefinite pronouns like "someone fixed the car" because  lots of languages, um, have W_H questions with an indefinite pronoun in situ or whatever, and you just get intonation to tell you that it's a question.	1
Use actually the same one.	0
So it makes sense  um	0
In - in logic, it's - it's -  @@   it's actual- Huh? What?	0
Right.  Let's put a Skolem -  [MASK] in, yeah.	0
That- that's not - that's not saying it's  bad,  it's just that -	0
that - that - the logicians have - have, uh -	0
It makes sense from that point of view, too, which is actually better. So yeah, um.	0
Anyway, but just that kind of thing and we'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on, but	1
Uh, no, all the focus stuff. We sort of just dropped that cuz it was too weird and we didn't even know, like, what we were talking about  exactly, what the object of study was. So.	1
Yeah. Well, if - if - I mean, i- part of - of what the exercise is, t- by the end of next week, is to say what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet.	1
Well, if you - if you	0
do  wanna discuss focus  background	0
get  me  into that because - I mean, I wo- I w- scientifically worked on that for - for almost two years.	0
O_K, then certainly we will. Good.	0
Yeah, you should definitely, um	0
be on on that - maybe - maybe by - after Monday we'll - y- you can see what things we are and aren't -	0
Yeah. w- We should figure out what our questions are, for example,  to ask you. So.	0
Has - I haven't seen Hans Boas?	1
O_K. So has he been - been involved with this, or - ?	0
Eh. with us? Yeah. I would say that tha- that those discussions have been primarily, um, Keith and - Keith and  me,  but um	0
like in th- the meeting - I mean, he sort of - I thin- like the  last  meeting we had, I think we were all very much part of it  but  um	0
Sometimes Hans has been sort of coming in there as sort of like a  devil's advocate type role or something,  like  "This make - you know, I'm going to pretend I'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this. This makes no sense." And he'll just go off on parts of it which  definitely need fixing but aren't where we're  at  right now, so it's	1
Like - like what you  call  certain things, which we decided long ago we don't care that much right now.	0
But in a sense, it's good to know that he  of all people - you know, like maybe a lot of people would have m- much stronger reactions, so, you know, he's like a relatively friendly linguist and  yet  a word like "constraint" causes a lot of problems.	0
O_K. This is consistent with	1
the role I had suggested that he - he  play,	1
o- one of the things I would like to see happen	1
is a paper that was tentatively called "Towards [MASK]"	1
these linguists  uh  who haven't been following  this stuff at all.	1
So  it  could  be that he's actually, at some level, thinking about how am I going to  communicate this story -	1
So,  internally,  we should just do  whatever works, cuz it's hard enough.	0
But  if he g- if he turns - is - is really gonna turn around and help t- to write this version that	0
does   connect with as many as possible of the  other linguists in the world	0
then  it becomes important to  use	0
make it  hard  - I mean, it's gonna be  plenty  hard for - for people to understand it as it is, but y- y- you don't want to make it  worse.	0
No, right. I mean, tha- that role is - is, uh, indispensable but that's not where sort of our heads were at in these meetings. It was a little strange.	0
Yeah, yeah. - No, that's fine. I just wanted t- to	0
I have to catch up with  him,  and I wanted t- to get a feeling for that. O_K.	0
So I don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly, you know.	0
Cuz sometimes he sort of sounds like we're talking a bunch of goobledy-gook from his point of view.	0
I think it's good when we're -	0
when we're into  data  and looking at the - some specific linguistic phenomenon  in - in English or in  German,  in particular, whatever,	1
that's  great,  and Ben and - and Hans are, if - if anything,  more  - you know, they have  more  to say than, let's say, I would about some of these things.	1
But when it's like, well, w- how do we  capture  these things, you know, I think it's definitely been Keith and I who have d- you know, who have worried more about the -	1
Well, that's good. That's - I- I- I think that  should  be the -	0
the core group  and  um	0
that's, you know, I think   very  close to the maximum number of people working together that can get something done.	0
Yeah . We actually  have  - I think we  have  been making progress, and its sort of surprising. You know, like -	0
I - I - I - I  definitely  get that impression. Yeah. That's great.	0
So anyone else would like uh  ruin the balance of -  Anyway.	0
Well, but -  Well.  But th- th- then w- then we have to come  back  to the bigger group.	0
Yeah.   Great. And then we're gon- we're gonna - because of this  other  big thing we haven't talked about is  actually implementing this stuff?	0
So that I guess the three of us are gonna connect tomorrow about that.	0
Yeah, we could talk tomorrow.	1
I was just gonna say, though, that, for instance, there was - you know, out of a meeting with Johno	1
came the suggestion that " oh,	1
could it be that [MASK] really  aren't  used for selection?" which has sort of been implicit  in the parsing  strategy we talked about. In which case we w- we can just say that they're the  effects  or the  bindings.	1
Which  uh,  so  far, in terms of like putting up all the constraints as, you know, pushing them into  type  constraints, the - when I've, you know, propo- then proposed it to linguists who  haven't  yet given me - you know, we haven't yet thought of a reason that that wouldn't work.	1
Right? As long as we allow our type constraints to be reasonably  complex.	1
So -  Anyway,  to be - to talk about later.	0
Yeah, it  has  to in the sense that	0
you're gonna use them eventu- it's - you know, it's sort of a, um, generate and  test	0
kind of thing, and if you  over-generate  then you'll have to do more. I mean, if there are  some  constraints that you hold back and don't use	1
uh, in your initial matching	0
then you'll match some things - I mean, I - I d- I don't think there's any way that it could  completely  fail. It - it could be that	0
uh, you wind up - I mean -	0
The original  bad  idea of purely [MASK]	0
died because  there were just  vastly  too many parses.	0
You know,  exponentially  num- num- many parses. And so th- the  concern  might be that - not that it would  totally  fail, but that -	0
That it would  still  generate too many.	0
Right? So by  just  having semantic- even bringing semantics in for matching  just  in the form of j- semantic types, right? Like	0
"conceptually these have to be construed as this, this, and this"	0
might  still  give us quite a few possibilities	0
We don't know, but, yeah.	0
that, you know - And - and	0
it certainly helps a lot. I mean, le- let's put it that way. So.	0
No question. Yeah. And I think it's a - it's a  perfectly  fine place to  start.	0
You know, and say, let- let's see how far we can  go  this way.	0
Well it  definitely  makes the problem easier.	0
I'm - I'm in favor of  that.	0
Uh, cuz I think i- I think it's - As you know, I think it's real hard and if w- if we -  Right.	0
Monday. So. O_K, that's -  Tuesday.  Like -  th- that's the conclusion. O_K.	0
So, you- your dance card is  completely filled now?	0
Yeah, and I have  nothing  to do this weekend but work.	0
No, that's not really true, but like -	0
What about - What about D_D_R?	0
Oh, I don't have it this weekend, so, tsk  don't have to worry about that.	0
Speaking of dance, Dance Dance Revolution  - I can't believe I'm - It's a - it's like a game, but it's for, like, dancing. Hard to - It's like karaoke, but for dancing,	0
It's a - It's - It's a video game? You stand there and	0
Oh that's - Oh, oh, oh!	0
and they tell you what - It's amazing. It's  so  much fun. Yeah, it's  so  good. My friend has a home version and he brought it over, and we are  so  into it. It's  so  amazing.	0
Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.	0
Oh, yeah! Now this -	0
Well, y- you know of it? I- i- i- it's one of your hobbies?	0
No, it's not one of my hobbies.	0
Although I - God knows I - I - I could use something like that.  @@	0
It's great exercise, I must say.	0
No, I - I - I -	0
I can't wait to hear this.	0
I see - I see it - things about it on T_V. O_K?	0
ap- Apparently - Oh, it's the hottest thing in Tokyo?	0
Oh,  definitely.  They have, like, places - instead of like - Yeah, instead of karaoke bars now that have, like, D_D_R, like -	0
That's the sort of thing that would be hot in Tokyo.	0
Yeah, I didn't know it by its initials.	0
Yeah, yeah, I didn't until I started hanging out with this friend, who's like "Oh, well, I can bring over the D_D_R if you want."	0
Oh, oh, Dance Dance Revolution - O_K.  He actually brought a clone called Stepping Selection, but it's just as good. So.  Anyw-	0
