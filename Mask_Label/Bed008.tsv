Alright, so I'm- I should read all of these numbers?	0
Piece of paper? I could borrow?	0
O_K, so uh i- um	0
I don't know whether Ami's coming or not um	0
but I think we oughta just get started.	0
Oh, so there you go.	0
Anyway, so my idea f- for today and we can uh	0
decide that that isn't the right thing to do	0
was to at - spend at least part of the time	0
eh build [MASK] you know	0
which sets of things are	0
uh specific s-  suggestion   to start first with the path ones.	0
in some sense less interesting to us although probably have to be done	0
and so to do that	0
so there's - and the idea was we were gonna do two things	0
Yeah. We were gonna do two things	1
[MASK] of what we think influences what	1
and then as a uh separate but related task	0
uh particularly Bhaskara and I were going to	0
what kinds of [MASK] are needed in order to	0
do what we - what we need to do. Once	0
so but du- we should sort of have all of the uh	1
basic design of what influences what	1
done before we decide exactly how to compute it.	1
So I didn't - did you get a chance to look at all - yet?	0
Yeah, I looked at some of that stuff.	0
uh [MASK] [MASK] and then we'll - then we'll also	0
at some point break and talk about the techy stuff.	0
Well I think one could go	0
I think we can di- discuss everything.	0
First of all this I added, I	0
sort of basically this has to be there right? Um	0
Oh are you gonna go there or not? Yeah, so one i-	0
Given - given uh uh not transverse the castle, the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just	0
Right, true. Does have to be there.	0
And I'm sure we'll find more as we go that	0
So [MASK] in the first place or not is definitely	1
uh one of the basic ones. We can start	1
there is this question about	0
we actually get just probabilities, right for each down here.	0
When we're - yeah when we're done.	0
the - the reason it might not be true or false	0
is that we did have this idea of when	0
uh current  @@  and so forth and so on or not at all, right?	0
And so that a decision would be	0
so you could - two different things you could do, you could have	1
all those values for [MASK] or you could have [MASK] be binary and given that you're going there	1
Yeah and so  forth .	0
I mean it seems that you could	0
uh it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would wanna have them	0
separate or binary, [MASK] and then the - the possibilities of how to go there because -	0
O_K, that's - let's start that way.	0
because, you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but	0
it's much more complex to query	0
when would be the most appropriate time.	0
And so I've tried to come up with some initial	0
things one could observe so who is the user?	0
Everything that has user comes from [MASK] everything that has situation comes from [MASK]	1
But when it comes to sort of writing down when you - when you do these things is it here?	0
have to a- write the values this can take.	0
And here I was really	0
s- sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because	0
um - this case it's pretty simple, but as we will see the other ones	0
for example if it's a running budget	0
so what are the discrete values of a running budget?	0
So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished.	0
How can I write here that this is something, a number that cr- keeps on changing?	0
You've s- have you seen this before at all Keith, [MASK]	0
Uh, no, but I think I'm following it.	0
So here is the - the - we had that the user's budget may influence	1
There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of	0
Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend?	0
O_K, h- well I mean how is it different from user finance?	0
Um the finance is sort of here thought of as - as the financial policy a person	1
carries out in his life, he - is he cheap, average, or spendy?	1
And um I didn't come uh maybe a user	0
I don't know, I didn't want to write greediness, but	0
w- what's behind this is actually a program that will	0
once you fill all this in actually s- solve [MASK] for you and stuff. So this is not just a display, this is actually a GUI to	1
if we tell it all the right things we'll	1
wind up with [MASK] at the other end.	1
And it's so simple even I can use it.	0
O_K, so here was O_K, I can think of uh	0
people being cheap, average, or spendy or we can even have a - a finer scale moderately cheap, doesn't matter.	0
I wasn't sure what to write in.	0
you've written in - you've written in what uh seems to be required like what else is - is	0
If that's permissible then I'm happy.	0
Well yeah. So here's - here's what's permissible	0
is gonna have to be updated and n- it's not a belief update, right? It's - you took some actions, you spent money and stuff, so the update of that	1
is gonna have to be essentially external to [MASK]	0
And then what you're going to need	0
the things that it influences. Well let's - first of all let's see if it does influence anything.	0
And if it does influence anything	1
then you're gonna need something that converts from	1
the - the number here to something that's relevant to the decision there.	1
So it could be ra- they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or	0
whatever - but for the moment this is just	0
a node that is conditioned externally	0
Yeah - this is where	0
The other thing is that um every time that's updated [MASK] will have to be propagated but then the question is	1
do you - do we wanna [MASK] every single time it's updated or only when we need to?	1
Yeah, that's a good question.	0
does it have [MASK]	0
Well, I mean, in Srini's thing there was this thing - there was this um	0
option like  [MASK] which suggests that uh	0
someone has to track that down, but I - but uh	0
And - and - and I think - actually uh	0
one of the we- w- items for the uh	0
I- they're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they're staying.	0
Oh just uh accidentally erased this, I - I just had values here such as uh	0
um is he s- we had	0
in our list we had "Is he staying in our hotel?", "Is he staying with friends?", and so forth  uh	0
it's clear where w- w- w- where we are right now.	0
So my suggestion is we just pick	0
one, you know one uh particular one of the uh	0
well let's do the first - first one let's do the one	0
sort of already think we did so w- that was the - of the endpoint?	1
So it's true or false?	0
No, that's - that's a  @@	0
What's the difference between mode	0
No, he has- he hasn't filled them in yet, is what's true.	0
Did I or didn't I?	0
Probably nothing done yet, oh I just did it on the upper ones, O_K.	0
O_K, so this was [MASK]	1
Maybe we can think of more things, cross	0
No no no, these are ju- that's just a point, this is ju-	0
Would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it?	0
Yeah, would be a f- for a given segment.	0
The Charles Bridge, you know.	0
You know, you - y- you go - first go the town square	0
No, I mean, if you go to re- you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your - your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge	0
and doesn't really matter which way you cross	0
which - where you end up at the end but the part - the good part is walking over it, so.	0
That's subtle, but true. Anyway	0
so let's just leave it three - with three for now	0
and let's see if we can get it linked up	0
You'll see it - you'll see something comes up immediately, that the reason I wanna do this.	0
w- well the uh user was uh	0
more likely to enter if he's a local	0
more likely to view if he's a tourist	0
and then of course we had the fact that	0
given the fact that he's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um	0
We did, but the three things w- that - that it contributed to this	0
in fact, the other two aren't up there.	0
so one was [MASK]	0
We'll d- what type of building is it? Yeah.	0
And the - and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse.	0
What he has mentioned before.	0
O_K, so this is w-	0
Right, so what w- I - what we seem to need here, this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff	1
the way we had been designing this, there were three intermediate nodes	1
uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from	1
[MASK] as seen from [MASK] and as seen from the discourse.	1
the way we had it designed, now we can change the design, but the design we had	0
was there was a decision with the same three outcomes	1
uh based on the th- those three separate considerations	1
so if we wanted to do that	0
Uh we can load it up it  you know  very simple.	0
would have to put in	0
and then what you and I have to talk about is, O_K if we're doing that and they get combined somehow	0
uh how do they get combined?	1
But the - they're - they're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about.	1
So this was adjusted for this one mode thing.	0
So that's w- w- in our uh in - in Johno's	0
sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to	0
whether a person wants to enter, view, or approach something.	0
Oh, it was called mode, so this - this is	0
here means the same as	0
We can just rename that, yeah.	0
O_K, why don't we ch- can we change that?	0
You know, but that was actually, yeah unfortunately	0
kind of an intermediate versio- that's I don't think what we would currently do.	0
Can I ask about "slurred" and "angry" as inputs to this?	0
Like they're either true or false and	0
if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech	1
they might be tired or, you know	1
And, you know, possibly uh	0
uh I was thinking less likely to view	1
Yeah. But that's- that seems to, yeah. So - so  my advice  to do is - is	1
get this down to what we think is actually likely to - to be a - a strong influence.	1
But yeah, that was what he had in mind.	0
So let's think about this - this question of	0
how do we wanna handle -	0
so there're two separate things. One is -	0
uh at least two. One is how do we want to handle the notion of [MASK]	0
now what we talked about, and this is another technical thing Bhaskara, is	0
uh can we arrange so that	0
so that [MASK] itself	1
and the properties are filled in uh from on- [MASK] So the - let's take the case of the	1
uh this endpoint thing, the notion was	0
that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site, you know some kind of landmark	0
is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter	0
So that there'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node	1
again as part of the ou- outer controlling conditioning of this thing	1
those would be set, so that some- somehow	1
someone would find this word, look it up in [MASK] pull out these properties, put it into	1
[MASK] and then the	1
Seems to me that we've sort of e- em-  embedded   a lot, em-	0
embedded a lot of these uh things we had	0
in - in - in some of the other final decisions done here, for example	0
if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something	0
um if it's exhibiting itself it is a landmark, meaning more likely to be viewed	0
if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this, then it's more likely to be	0
I uh that's - I think that's completely right	0
I think that's good, right?	0
So what - what that says is that we might be able to	0
in particular so - so the ones we talked about were	0
If it's closed one probably won't enter.	0
Or if it's not accessible to a tourist ever	0
the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it, given that he knows it, of course.	0
Alright. So let me suggest this.	0
w- could you move those up about halfway.	0
The ones that you th-	0
Yeah, all - all of these if it's fixing things	1
selling things, or servicing things	1
So here - here's what it looks like	0
is that you want an intermediate structure	0
which i- uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of -	0
of uh selling, f- fixing, or	0
that is, for certain purposes, it becomes important but for this kind of purpose	1
uh one of these places is quite like the other.	1
So we di- if we	0
you're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision? Yeah.	0
Yes. So if - well it may be more than endpoint decisions, so the idea would be	1
that you might wanna merge those three	1
Yeah. Eh ser- s- uh selling, fixing, and servicing.	0
What ex- um and so either those is true f- or false?	1
Uh well it - it - i- here's where it gets a little tricky.	0
Uh from [MASK] point of view it is	0
from another point of view of course it's interest- it's - it's important to know what it's	0
selling or servicing and so forth.	1
it's just uh true or false	1
and in th- this is a case where the or seems just what you want.	0
That - that if any of those things is true	1
then it's the kind of place that you	1
Um more likely to enter.	0
are more likely to enter.	1
So you just wanna have them all pointing to a	0
Yeah, so let's do that.	0
No no, no eh to - to an inter- no, an intermediate node.	0
That's the p- part of the idea, is	0
Um is - is that [MASK]	0
So are they the - is it the kind of object that sells, fixes, or services things?	0
Well, o- open up object type and let's see what its values are.	0
Oh I just created it, it has none so far.	0
Oh, well O_K first of all it's not objects, we called them entities, right?	0
And then we have sort of the um	0
Let's say I put commercial.	0
Yeah, I w- I was just gonna commercial action inside	0
Well  couldn't I  do - let's do commercial	0
accessible I think is different	0
cuz that's tempor- that - that [MASK] whereas	0
What would a hotel fall under?	0
I would call that a service, but - but I don't know.	0
Well I mean in terms of [MASK]	0
Say w- w- well it's co- I would s- a- a- again	0
for this purpose I think it's commercial.	0
Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business.	0
[MASK] at the end of each of those things signify?	0
So places that service things	0
sell things or fix things and pe-	0
places that e- exhibit things.	0
That also points to [MASK] I guess.	0
this - the - this feature of whether the -	1
the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there?	1
Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the	0
Well you could, that's a - that's a choice.	0
I mean it seems like that's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and	0
you know indoor places that do something else and	0
Yeah, the problem with it is	0
putting in a feature just for one decision, now w- we may wind up having to do that	0
this i- anyway, this i-	0
at a mental level that's what we- we're gonna have to sort out.	1
So, you know what does this look like, what are - what are	1
uh intermediate things that are worth computing, what are the features we need	1
and what's the best way to organize this	1
it's clean and - and	1
consistent and all that sort of stuff.	1
I'm just thinking about how	0
people, human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this and it would probably - you wouldn't just	0
sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that	0
Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things, it can either	0
it must be going on inside or something.	0
do s- do sell things, fix things, service things, exhibit things, it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things, it's not either or mmm	0
certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site.	0
um a landmark and be accessible.	0
I_E a - a castle or can be a landmark a- or not accessible, some statue  you know  can	0
Anyway so let me suggest you do something else.	0
get rid - get rid of that l- long link between who - the user	0
Could we just move it like this?	0
No no, I don't want the link there at all.	0
Because what we're gonna want is an intermediate	0
endpoint decisi- the endpoint decision	0
based o- on [MASK] so what we - we - what we talked about is three separate	0
endpoint decisions, so let's make a new node	0
Just as a suggestion maybe you could "save as" to	0
keep your old one nice and clean and	0
so you can mess with this one.	0
The old one was not that	0
not that important, I think but	0
O_K, well, not a big deal then.	0
Isn't there a "save as" inside of [MASK]	0
I can just take this	0
This was user something or	0
Well this was uh let's p- put it this - let's do endpoint	0
i- endpoint, e- end poi- this is sa-	0
let's say [MASK] so that's the endpoint decision	0
uh as seen through the	0
As related from [MASK]	0
So let's - let's actually	0
yeah so lin- you can link that up to the	0
Should I rename this  too? No.	0
uh yeah, so that, I guess that's endpoint	0
[MASK] for entity, and we may change all this, but.	0
O_K, shouldn't I be able to move them all? No.  Or - ?   Can I?	0
Oh I d- eh I don't know.	0
Actually, I guess the easiest thing would move - mo-	0
move the endpoint, well, go ahead.	0
I think you have to be in [MASK] before	0
So now we're looking for user related things that um	0
Yeah. And uh maybe th- maybe it's just one who is the user, I don't know, maybe - maybe there's more.	0
Well if he's usi- if he's in a car right now	0
people with Harry drove the car into the cafe	0
Now but the - now so - so - but then the question is	0
so - and - and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through [MASK] but then we had this third idea	1
of [MASK]	1
let's - should we finish this, I mean but surely the user interests	0
The user thrift, the user budget.	0
Well, maybe, I- again, I d-	0
well, O_K, put em in but	0
what we're gonna wanna do is actually uh	0
Here this was one of my problems we have	1
the user interest is a - is a vector of five hundred values, so	1
Oh you mean level of interest?	0
That's from [MASK] mm-hmm, no not levels of interest but things you can be interested in.	0
somebody else has built [MASK]	0
oh it, so it's like a vector of five hundred ones or zeros?	0
Like for each thing are we - are you interested in it or not?	0
yeah uh I - I think	0
uh you cou- and so here let me give you two ways to handle that.	0
One is um you could ignore it.	0
But the other thing you could do	0
is have an - and this  will  give you the flavor of the - of what  @@	0
you could have a node that's - that was a measure of the match between the	1
object's feature, you know, the match between the object	1
So you could have a k- [MASK]	0
and again that would have to be computed by someone else	0
Just as a mental note	0
should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of - of entering?	0
if it's an expensive place to enter, this may also	0
"Do I have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the Koelner Dome  or do I just have to -"	0
"time to take a picture of the outside?"	0
It seems like everything in [MASK] a- affects -	1
Well that's what we don't wanna do, see that - se- cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that	1
Cuz if the, I mean, and if the user is tired, the user state, right, it would affect	0
I can't see why e- anything w- everything in the model wouldn't be	0
Well, that - that's - we can't do that, so we- we're gonna have to	0
but this is a good discussion, we're gonna have to somehow figure out	1
uh some way to encapsulate	1
uh so if there's some general notion	1
relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or	1
something like that is - is the uh	1
compatibility with his current state, so that's what you'd have to do, you'd have to get it down to something	1
was itself relatively compact, so it could be	0
compatibility with his current state	0
which would include his money and his time and - and his energy	0
Yeah, just seems like it'd push the problem back a level. Yeah, but	1
No but, it's more than that, like the - the more sort of you break it up  @@  like because if you have everything pointing to one node it's like exponential	1
whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it's not exponential anymore.	0
So it yeah, there are two advantages. That's tha- there's one technical one	0
and the other is it - it gets used	0
S- so we'd basically be doing [MASK]	0
so basically make it more tree like going backwards?	0
But it - there's two advantages, one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential	1
uh [MASK] the other is it can be - it presumably can be used for multiple decisions.	1
So that if you have this idea	0
of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to	0
the state of the user	0
one could well imagine that that was u-	0
not only is it sim- is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it's used in multiple places.	0
Anyway th- so in general this is the design, this is really design problem.	1
O_K, you've got a signal, a d- set of decisions	0
um how do we do this?	0
What do I have under user state anyhow	0
cuz I named that already something.	0
Oh that's tired, fresh, yeah.	0
Maybe should be renamed into physical state.	0
Or fat- user fatigue even.	0
Then we can make a user state.	0
What's th- what we're talking about is compatibility.	0
Uh or something, I don't know, but.	0
I guess the - the question uh is	0
It's hard for me to imagine how	1
everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again.	1
we had some things that	1
The user interests and the user	0
who - who - who the user is	0
are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired	0
Sure, but  other  - I thought though the node we're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action, right?	0
Seems like everything in [MASK] would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something.	0
Uh maybe not. I mean the - that's the - the issue is um	0
Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of.	0
And anyway we're gonna have to find some way to cl-	1
uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible.	1
Maybe um if we look at the - if we split it up again into sort of um	0
if we look at the uh the endpoint again	0
we - we said that	0
for each of these things there are certain preconditions	0
so you can only enter a place if you are	0
not too tired to do so	0
and also eh have the money	0
to do so if it costs something	0
so if you can afford it	0
Is that always true? I don't know.	0
Well, with the way we're defining it I think yeah.	0
but that eh viewing it without ent- yeah view w- with our definition of view it's free	0
Well what about the Grand Canyon, right? No, never mind. I mean are there - are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to like, I mean	0
never mind, not in the current -	0
No we have to enter the park.	0
paying involves entering, ge- going through some	0
So let me suggest we switch to	0
another one, I mean clearly there's more work to be done on this but I think it's gonna be more instructive to - to think about	1
uh other decisions that we need to make in path land.	1
And what they're gonna look like.	0
So you can save this one as and open up the old one, right and -	0
and then everything would be clean.	0
You could do it again.	0
Why, I think it's worth saving this one but I think I'd - I'd like to keep this one cuz I wanna see if -	0
if we're gonna reuse any of this stuff.	0
Well you tell me, so in terms of the	1
Well let's - th- this	0
planner what's - what's a good one to do?	1
go there or not I think is a good one.	1
Is a very basic one.	0
what makes things more likely	0
Well the fir- see the first thing is, getting back to thing we left out of the other	1
So Keith this is gonna get into your world because	1
uh we're gonna want to know	1
you know, which constructions indicate	1
yet know how to do this, I guess	1
we're gonna wind up pulling out	1
uh [MASK] like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet.	1
So that - that [MASK] will have	0
uh discourse, and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be	0
We - we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint.	0
again re- that's completely correct, we have [MASK] [MASK] here, we don't have [MASK] here yet.	0
Much the same way as we didn't - we don't have [MASK] here.	0
Well [MASK] we sort of	0
said we would pull these various kinds of properties from [MASK] like exhibiting, selling, and so forth.	0
So in some sense it's - it's there.	0
But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet.	0
This be specific for second year?	0
And - and we probably will have uh	0
something like a discourse for endpoint.	0
But if we do it'll have the three values.	0
It'll have [MASK] if - if we have it.	0
For [MASK] probably is true and false, let's say. That's what we talked about.	1
we're looking at the - the little data that we have, so people say how do I get to	0
and this usually means they wanna go there.	0
So this should sort of	0
however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out	0
without wanting to go there.	0
And sometimes um people say where is it	0
because they wanna know where it is	0
but in most cases they probably	0
Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that you're - you want these two values.	0
So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it's either	0
yep, yay, A_, or nay.	0
And they'll be a y- uh, a user	1
and maybe that's all, I don't know.	0
[MASK] I mean, because it's - whether it's open or not.	1
um what's the word um	0
the - that interacts with the uh	0
[MASK] if they just wanna view it	0
then it's fine to go there when it's closed	0
whereas if they want to um	0
Right, so that's - that's where it starts getting to be uh	0
uh essentially more interesting, so what	0
uh Bhaskara says which is completely right	0
is if you know that they're only going to view it then	0
it doesn't matter whether it's closed or not in terms of	0
The time of day, right I - well, right.	0
you know, whether - whether you wanna go there.	0
It does matter though if there's like a strike or riot or something.	0
Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter.	0
yeah, that's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because	0
this - that node by itself wouldn't distinguish	0
Well i- i- it can have di- various values.	0
Yeah, but we eh you - you're right it might not be enough.	0
Yeah, I mean, see I'm -	1
I'm thinking that any node that begins with [MASK]	1
is either gonna be true or false.	1
I see that could be.	0
Also, that node, I mean	0
[MASK] would just be fed by separate ones for	0
you know, there's different things, the strikes and the	0
Like situation traffic and so on.	0
Yeah, the time of day.	0
So - so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out	0
is what this says is that	0
uh there sh- should be a link, and this is where things are gonna get very messy	0
decision maybe the t- they're final re- and, I guess	0
the very bottom endpoint decision	0
uh to [MASK]	0
And I - don't worry about layout, I mean then we'll go - we'll go nuts	0
Maybe we could um have  intermediate   node that just [MASK]	0
Because that's what we, I mean that's why this situation comes up.	0
Well [MASK] actually [MASK] could feed - feed into [MASK]	0
That's right, so [MASK] make that up t- t-	0
and again we'll have to do layout at some point, but something like that.	0
Now it's gonna be important not to have loops by the way.	0
Uh really important in - in [MASK] not to have loops uh	1
How long does it take you to - to	0
No it's much worse than that.	0
It - if i- loo-	0
It - things don't converge, yeah.	0
it - it - it - it - it's not def- i- it's not well defined if you're there are loops, you just	0
there are all sorts of ways of	0
breaking it up so that there isn't	0
Uh but this isn't, this is - this line is just coming from over here.	0
Yeah, no it's not a loop yet, I'm just saying we - we, in	0
Well, but the good thing is we -	0
we could have [MASK] which	0
O_K, so anyway, so that's another decision.	0
Uh what's - what's another decision you like?	0
O_K, these have no parents yet, but I guess that sort of doesn't matter.	0
Well, the idea is that you go there, you go comes from something about the user	0
I mean this is sort of	0
This comes from traffic and so forth, yeah.	0
from something about the situation	0
the discourse is - is a mystery.	0
Should we just make some	0
And if he has seen it already or not	0
and discourse is something that sort of	0
should we make a Keith note here? That sort of comes from Keith.	0
Have to get used to this.	0
And then also the discourse endpoint, I - I guess endpoint sub-D_ is - if you wanna make it consistent.	0
Um actually is this the - the right way to have it where um	0
go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of	0
don't know about each other but they both feed [MASK] because	0
But that still allows for the possibility of the - of	0
[MASK] affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from -	0
That - all that - that kind of decision making happens at [MASK]	0
Uh y- you - yeah you - i- you - if you needed to do that.	0
If you needed it to do that.	0
But uh O_K I was just thinking	0
I guess maybe I'm conflating that user node with	0
possible - possible asking of the user	0
hey there's a strike on, uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something or	0
Good point, I don't - I don't know how we're going to - t- uh	0
Yeah, so that might not come out of [MASK] but, you know, directly out of	0
I gu- yes my curr- you know, don't yeah yeah yeah that's enough.	0
My current idea on that	0
would be that each of these decision nodes has	0
And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things	0
you know, given that you know there's a strike do you still wanna go?	0
uh if you told him a bunch of stuff, then you would ask him do you wanna go? But	0
trying to formulate the conditional question, that sounds too much.	0
Alright, but let me - let - let's stay with this a minute because I want to do a little bit of organization.	0
Before we get more into details.	0
The organization is going to be that	0
uh the flavor of what's going on	0
is going to be that	0
uh as we s- e- sort of going to this detail	0
indeed Keith is going to - to worry about the various constructions that people might use	0
and Johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard, so	1
what's going to happen is	1
like by the time he graduates, O_K	0
uh they'll be some sort of system	1
take the discourse in context	1
outputs that can feed [MASK]	1
I j- wa- I - I assume everybody knows that, I just wanna	0
you know, get closure that	0
that'll be the game then, so the	0
semantics that you'll get out of the	0
of values that go into	0
the various [MASK]	0
And now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff so it isn't by any means	1
thing that you want out.	0
So uh if there is an- and there is mode of transportation	0
there's a sort of also a split if you loo- if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said	0
what's the utterance go- giving us	0
and then what's [MASK]	0
Yeah, well that, well, we'll have to decide	0
That's uh two things  then .	0
how much of th- where that goes.	0
an- and it's not clear yet.	0
I mean it could be those are two separate things, it could be that [MASK]	0
itself integrates em as - which would be my guess	0
that you'd have to do	1
see in order to do reference and stuff like that	1
um you've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say	1
I wanna go back there, wow, what does that mean and	1
But is th- is this picture that's emerging here	0
just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry or is it that we get for each -	0
each decision on the very bottom we sort of get [MASK]	0
and maybe [MASK]	0
This is - this is getting into the thing I wanna talk about next, which is	0
uh how do we wanna combine those?	0
O- or when it's true?	0
but this eh w- wou- wou- would be nice though that, you know, we only have	0
at most four at the moment	0
arrows going f- to each of the uh	0
And four you - we can handle.	0
i- i- it see- i- if it's fou- if it's four	0
things and each of them has four values	0
it turns out to be [MASK] it's not s- completely impossi- I mean it's - it's not beyond what the system could solve	0
but it's probably beyond what we could actually	0
Uh but, you know it's	0
Two fifty-six, is that what that	0
and I don't think it's gonna g- e- I don't think it'll get worse than that by the way, so le- that's a - that's a good	0
didn't we decide that all of these had true or false? So is - it's four	0
Uh for go there, but not f- but not for - the other one's three values for endpoint already.	0
Yeah, I mean you need actually three to the five because uh	0
well I mean if - if it has four inputs and then it itself has three values so	0
I mean it can get big fast.	0
Um for endpoint? No it's - it's sh-	0
this one only has two.	0
No it still has three, [MASK]	0
Since ta- they will still have three.	0
Each - so you're uh uh from each point of view you're making the same decision.	0
from the point of view of the ob- of the entity	0
Want to view that, yeah yeah.	0
This - and also, I mean, the other places where, like for example	0
consider endpoint view, it has inputs coming from user budget, user thrift	0
Those are not necessarily binary.	1
S- so we're - we're gonna have to use some t- care in [MASK]	1
to not have this explode.	1
And in fact I think it doesn't in the sense that	0
Read it, you know actually with the underlying semantics and stuff I think it isn't like	0
you have two hundred and fifty-six different	0
ways of - of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some  place.	0
So we - we just have to figure out what the regularities are and	1
What I was gonna suggest next	0
is maybe we wanna work on this a little longer	0
but I do want to also talk about	0
the thing that we started into now of	0
well it's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si- same place	0
So th- yes they - so these things all affect it, how do they affect it?	0
And [MASK] have their own beliefs about uh what are good ways to do that.	0
So is it - it's - it's clearer n- clear enough what the issue is, right?	0
So do we wanna switch that now or we wanna do some more of this?	0
w- we just need to sort of	0
in order to get some closure on this	0
how we're gonna get this picture sort of uh	0
he- here's one of the things that - that I th-	0
you sh- you - no, I don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface	1
but you - it would be great if you could	1
uh all the things that you pick up, you click on [MASK] O_K	1
and everything else fades and you just see	1
the links that are relevant to that.	1
And I  does   anybody remember	0
Uh d- I would  almost say  the other way to do that would be to open u- or make	0
you know [MASK] and then open them	0
every time you wanted to look at a different one	0
It's probably pretty easy do it - to do it in H_T_M_L, just -	0
Yeah I have each of these thing- each of [MASK] be - be a page and then you click on the thing and then	0
li- consider that it's respective, but	0
the - well the b-	0
that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gonna be able to read the diagram.	0
e- we have to figure out some eh eh	0
basically display hack or something to do this because	0
I - I - let me consi- suggest that's a s- not a first-order consideration, we have two first-order considerations	0
which is what are the	0
how do they get combined mathematically, how do we display them is an issue, but	0
I don't, yeah I just don't think this has been designed to support	0
Yeah, I - I mean, it might soon, if this is gonna be used in a serious way like [MASK] then it might soon be necessary to uh start	1
modifying it for our purposes.	1
Um I - that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into, but	0
we have to know what we want first.	0
O_K, so why don't you tell us a little bit about	0
[MASK] and what - what the choices might be for these?	0
Ah, sorry. I guess that's	0
You can technically wear that as you're talking.	0
right, I guess I can do that.	0
Put it in your, yeah.	0
I guess this board works fine.	0
So um recall the basic problem which is that um	1
you have [MASK] and you have like	1
a lot of different nodes	1
all contributing to one node.	1
specifying this kind of thing	1
is a big pain and it's so- will take a long time to write down because	1
for example if these  S  have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have	0
two hundred and forty-three possibilities which is already	0
a lot of numbers to write down.	0
So what um helps us in our situation is that	1
have values in the same set, right? These are all like	1
saying E_V or A_, right? So it's not just a generalized situation like	1
basically we wanna just take a combination of - we wanna view each of these as experts	1
each of them is making a decision based on some factors	1
and we wanna sort of combine their decisions	1
All of their outputs combined to make a decision.	0
the problem is to specify the uh	1
so the conditional property of	1
this given all those, right? That's the way	1
[MASK] are defined, like each node given its parents, right?	1
that's what we want, we want for example [MASK] of um	0
let's call this guy [MASK] and let's call these [MASK]	0
So we want probability that [MASK] equals, you know, for example	0
given that these guys are	0
I'll just refer to this as like [MASK]	0
[MASK] or something,  uh  the co- like all of them?	0
Given that for example the data says you know, [MASK] or something	0
So we would like to do this kind of combination.	0
Is that uh I - yeah, I just wanna make sure everybody is with us	0
It's - it's cl- e-	0
is - is it clear what	0
what we don't wanna do is to	0
for every single combination of	0
--Jargon--E_ and V_ and A_--Jargon-- and every single letter E_, s- give a number because that's	0
What we wanna do is find some principled way of um	0
saying what each of these is	0
and we want it to be a valid probability distribution, so we want it to um	0
add up to one, right?	0
So those are the two things that we uh need.	0
what uh I guess, what Jerry suggested earlier was basically	1
view these guys as voting and we just take the uh	1
averages, right? So for example	1
here two people have voted for A_, one has voted for V_, and one has voted for E_, so we could say that	0
the probabilities are, you know, probability of being E_ is one	0
over four, because one person voted for E_ out of four	0
so this is probability of E_	0
s- and then probability of A_	0
given all that is um two out of four	0
and probability of V_ is one out of four.	0
step - that's the uh	0
yeah that's the - that's the basic uh thing.	0
And that one outcome, that's	0
[MASK] voted for [MASK] and so forth?	0
S- so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things, which	1
may or may not be a good assumption, so that	1
So step two is um	1
right. So we've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that	0
you know, some w- be that for example, what the um	0
the uh verbal content of what the person said, like what	0
uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than	0
[MASK] matters more i- than [MASK] or	0
Sure, so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we've been giving them all weight one fourth	1
so we could replace this by uh	0
[MASK]	0
And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each um	0
[MASK] we just need that [MASK] sum to one.	0
So they can be for example, you know	0
you - you could have point one, point three, point two, and point four, say.	0
So that um also seems to work fine.	0
So I jus- just to make sure I understand this, so in this case	0
You'd compute the weighted average, so	1
so in this case the probability that [MASK] would be	0
[MASK] times - or [MASK] or - let's see, one  full  quarter times point one	0
these numbers have been replaced with point one, point three, point two, and point four.	0
So it would be, in this case	0
So you can view these as gone.	0
you just add up the - Yeah. So it would - it would - in this case, it would be -  [MASK] would be point three.	0
[MASK] - yeah, [MASK] would be point three and [MASK] would be point four.	0
If that - if that was the voting plan.	0
So this is uh step two.	1
So the next possibility is that um	1
we've given just a single weight to each expert, right, whereas it might be the case that um	1
in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable.	1
the way this is handled is by what's called a mixture of experts, so	0
what you can have is	0
you augment these diagrams like this so	0
you have a new thing called [MASK] O_K? This is [MASK]	1
it gets its input from [MASK] and what it does is it decides	1
which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation.	1
So this is sightly uh more complicated.	0
So what's going on is that um	0
[MASK] looks at these four	0
values of those guys and it decides in	0
which of these isn't likely to be	0
more reliable or most reliable.	0
you know, it produces a number, either one, two, three, or four, in our situation, right?	1
he looks at [MASK]	0
say it's two, and then he just selects the uh	0
@@  - Yeah, so that's  one  thing you can do, but the  other  - So, are you going to go on and  say  @@  -	0
That's all there is to say, I guess about it.	0
No it isn't. Because the  other  thing you can do is you - So this - in this case, a mixture of experts just picks one.	0
Right, so you can have a mixture that	0
A  weighted  one. So what you can  do,  if you - if you  need  it is to say that - I mean  here  there's a  fourth  parameter. There's a  fifth  parameter.	0
O_K? which is [MASK]	0
So let's suppose [MASK] says in situ-  @@  different uh,  [MASK]	0
O_K, in [MASK] that's [MASK] but in [MASK]  it's [MASK]	0
So you still combine these with weight, but the weights aren't always the same.	0
That this guy uh detects for you that this is a situation in which you should weight this  more  or  less.	0
So - so the function of the thing that comes out of [MASK] is very different from the function of the other inputs.	0
Correct. It's actually s- it - it -	0
It's driving how the other four are interpreted.	0
It's - it's - it's conditioning how the other four are  @@ . And what people  do,  in another literature, is  learn  all this stuff. So you learn the weights, you can learn the expert, et cetera. And if you have enough data, then it makes perfectly good sense to  do  this.	0
So [MASK] passes a vector on to the next node?	0
Well now, y- it - it - Well it  could,  or you co- could just pass other -	0
A vector of the weights as  the se- oh .	0
No, no. No. Not normally. It would just pass a - a selection. So - so it  could  pass either -	0
Well a vector with three zeros and one one, right?	0
Well, it  could.  Yeah. If - if -	0
@@  Yeah, it  could  do  that.	0
O_K. Uh, you know, uh, uh, a ma- [MASK]	0
Oh it's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it's in	0
We- yeah. Or w- in  this  case, wh- which one of these guys to pay attention to.	0
or which one of [MASK]	0
W- I was just, if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w- [MASK] though too, couldn't you?	1
I mean the way you desc-	0
I mean, the way you -	0
Well, that - yo- You  could  but I think what - that's not - that's  harder  than to just say they're a discrete number of situations and this says, you know, hey, you're in [MASK]	0
Does [MASK] have to have another input to tell it alpha, beta, whatever, or is the -	0
that's determined by what the experts are saying, like the type of situ- O_K.	0
Yeah. Or in  @@  definitely could have - have other - it  absolutely  could have other inputs from something that has n- doesn't have anything directly to do with these experts.	0
And it's s- it actually often does. So it is -	0
It - it just seems that like without that - that outside input that you've got a situation where, you know, like if - if uh [MASK]	0
says no, you know, a low value coming out of X_on- or i- if [MASK] says no then ignore [MASK] you know, I mean that seems like	0
Yeah, well could be things like if [MASK] say yes then i- ignore [MASK] also.	0
Or if [MASK] is greater than [MASK] I could imagine i- all  sorts  of garbage.	0
And  so these - so this is - this is one collection of technology that we could bring to bear. Yeah.	0
The situations that [MASK] has, are they built into [MASK] or	1
O_K, so they - they could either be hand coded or learned or	1
It depends on - on - on, you know, what situations you're  in.	0
Based on training data, O_K.	1
And  there're bits  @@  actually Michael  Jordan  did a lot of nice work, uh, earlier on sit- situations which you could actually train these up and stuff.	0
Um, I don't think we're gonna be in a situation where realistically we're gonna have enough data to actually train these things, uh, anytime soon.	0
But, I still think it's a nice idea if the architecture  supports  it.	0
So that, you know, you say, "here's the  design  and if enough data comes along uh, you co- you could use it - use the technology to - to  do  that."	0
I still have trouble understanding the  very  first step, maybe just because I'm approaching it from the very wrong end. I don't know.	0
So, this is true for the case that [MASK] voted for [MASK] [MASK] voted for [MASK]	0
Now, [MASK] could potentially also vote  [MASK] .	0
That wo- that would be another sort of i-  Absolutely.	0
So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi-	0
to learn them we need data, where are we gonna get data?	0
I mean we need data with people intentions, right?	1
But what's the data about like, are we able to get these nodes from the data?	1
Like how thrifty the user is, or do we have access to that?	0
Yeah, but that's my question, like how do we - I mean, how do we have data about something like um	0
or [MASK]	0
Well, basically you would say, based on - in this dialogue that we have	0
which one of the things that they said eh whether it was [MASK] or whatever	0
was the thing that determined what mode it was, right?	0
So this is what we wanna learn.	0
you have a - can you bring up the function thing?	0
w- where is the thing that allows you to sort of	0
That's on the added variable, isn't it?	0
Oh [MASK] is that it?	0
And um it so e- either it'll allow us to do everything which I think is unlikely, I think more likely it'll allow us to do very few of these things	0
and in that case we'll have to um	0
just write up little things that allow you to um	0
create such C_P_U's on your own in [MASK]	0
Yeah, I was assuming that's what we'd always do because	0
yeah I was assuming that's what we'd always do, it's	0
Well in terms of [MASK] I think it's basically what you see is what you get in	1
yeah, I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here.	1
By the way um uh just talking about uh about that general end of things uh	0
is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they're interacting with the system and so on? Like, I mean, what kind of questions are being given - being asked? Cuz -	0
I'm just wondering, because in terms of, you know, I mean	0
uh w-  the figure - I was thinking about this figure that we talked about, fifty constructions or whatever that's uh that's a whole lot of constructions  and um you know, I mean one might be f-	1
fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of	1
five maybe ten in a summer	1
so, I mean I know we're going for sort of a	1
I mean, I - I - I - I was - uh I was talking about the, you know, if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all the detail for what we're doing right now	0
but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know	0
which fifty do I do, I wanna see what people are using, so	0
Well, it will inspire me.	0
