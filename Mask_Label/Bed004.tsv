Hey, you're not supposed to be drinking in here dude.	0
So you can just um, you know, say the number at the transcript top,  the thing  that says "transcript".	0
Do we have to read them that slowly?	0
O_K. Sounded like a robot.	0
Great. I'm thinking, why don't you guys go ahead and start - I mean, the data of the - of you guys talking to each other is still useful. And then when your colleagues come in you know, it'll - it's recording now, so it'll just keep recording.	0
And then if - Would you do me a big favor, um, maybe Robert, cuz you know how to do this,  that's just  hitting the square? the black square when you're done?	0
But make sure not to hit the "record" again. It will erase everything.	0
If you hit that black square, that's great.	0
I'm gonna be in the meeting that might run over to four o'clock  @@   finished .	0
And then when you leave, just turn off the microphones, the batteries  go  up and down and - That's great.	0
And if Jerry and Nancy are willing to read the numbers that would be great as well.	0
At least we got yours.	0
O_K. Thanks. Have a good meeting.	0
When you read the numbers it kind of reminded me of beat poetry.	0
I tried to go for the E_E Cummings sort of feeling, but -	0
Three three six zero zero.	0
Four two zero zero one seven.	0
That's what I think of when I think of  beat  poetry.	0
You ever seen "So I married an axe murderer"?	0
There's a part wh- there's parts when he's doing beat poetry.	0
And he talks like that.	0
That uh  probably  is why I  think  of it that way.	0
No, I  didn't  see that movie. Who did - who  made  that?	0
Mike Meyers is the guy.	0
It- it's his uh - it's his cute romantic comedy. That's - that's -	0
That's his cute romantic comedy, yeah.	0
The other thing that's real funny,	0
I'll spoil it for you.	0
is when he's - he works in a coffee shop,	0
and uh he's sitting there on this couch and they bring him this  massive  cup of espresso,	0
and he's like "excuse me I ordered the  large  espresso?"	0
tiramisu tasting contest this weekend.	0
Wait - do are y-	0
So you're trying to decide who's the best  taster  of tiramisu?	0
No? Um. There was a - a -	0
a fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best and so we decided to have a contest where those people who	0
claim to make good tiramisu  make  them, and then we got a panel of impartial judges that will taste - do a blind taste	0
Seems like you could put a s- magic special ingredient in, so that everyone know which one was  yours.	0
Then, if you were to  bribe  them, you could uh -	0
Well, I was thinking if um - y- you guys have plans for Sunday? We're - we're not - it's probably going to be this Sunday, but um we're sort of working with the weather here	0
because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what - whoever brings whatever	0
you know, can throw it on there.	0
So only the tiramisu is free,	0
back to visit my  parents  this weekend, so, I'll be out of town.	0
So you're going to the  west  Bay then?	0
No, the  South  Bay, yeah.	0
Well,  I  should be free, so.	0
O_K, I'll let you know.	0
I'm sorry. I was looking for you guys downstairs. I didn't know that you had moved the meeting. Alright.	0
So, are we recording ourselves?	0
Is Nancy s- uh gonna show up?	0
She's got a student with her now. So, she probably won't.	0
Wonder if these things ever	0
like, piercing screech right in your ear?	0
No, no. The Human Subjects Committee wouldn't allow it.	0
They are gonna get more comfortable headsets.	0
Should I go first, with the uh,	0
data. Can I have the remote  control. Thank you.	0
So. On Friday we had our wizard test data test	1
these are some of the results.	1
even though Liz was uh kind enough to offer to be the first subject, I	0
sort of felt that she knew too  much,   so I asked uh Litonya.	0
on the spur of the moment, and she was uh kind enough to uh	0
serve as the first subject. So, this is what she  saw  as part of - as uh for instr- introduction, this is what she had to  read	1
Uh, that was really difficult for her	0
Because of l- all the names, you mean?	0
this was the uh first three tasks she had to - to master after she  called  the system,	1
then of course the system broke down, and those were the l- uh	0
uh I should say the system was  supposed  to break down and then um these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to  solve,  with a  human  -	1

Thank you for calling Heidelberg Tourist Information. How may I help you?	0
Wait, can I -  I  have a question.  So.	0
Hi. I want to um	0
So there's  no  system, right? Like, there was a wizard for both uh - both parts, is this right?	1
Yeah. It was bo- it both times the same person.	1
One time,  pretending  to be a system, one time, to -  pretending  to be a  human,  which is actually not pretending. I should -	1
And she didn't - I mean. Well. Isn't this kind of obvious when it says "O_K now you're talking to a human" and then the human has the same voice?	0
O_K, good question, but uh	0
you - you just wait and see.	0
It's - You're gonna l- learn.	0
And um the wizard sometimes will  not  be audible,	0
Because she was actually - they - there was some uh lapse in the um wireless,	0
we have to move her closer.	0
I'm deciding on going to the concert of the Hindelberg - for the Hindelberg Symphony Orchestra.	0
I want to buy something elegant in one of the designer boutiques	0
which is located on   Friedrich Ebert um Anlage?    Do you understand that?	0
In order to get to the   Friedrich Ebert Anlage,   turn around and go towards the church. Next you have to t- at the church into the   Friedrich Ebert Anlage.	0
Is she mispronouncing   "Anlage"?   Is it   "Anlaga"   or   "Anlunga"	0
I want  @@  what a um sunken castle is.	0
They're mispronouncing  everything,  but it's -	0
A sunken castle differs from the regular sort of castle in that it is built in a flat region, rather than on a mountain.	0
Oh, and I also remember that someone told me about the historic graffiti in the old student prison.	0
And I wanted to know how to get there.	0
In order to get to the student prison, from the university square, turn right,  and walk one block.	0
This is the system breaking down, actually.	0
Uh, I'm sorry, something uh seems to have happened to the system. Um, - see if I can help you.	0
Are you a live person? or is this a recording?	0
Th- I'm a live person.	0
O_K. Um, thing I was gonna ask you, um, O_K,	0
I need to know where you are, first of all-	0
W- where am I? Um, I don't know.	0
See - c- figure it out?	0
I see a building that's um under construction.	0
That's p- that's probably the university square.	0
O_K. So, that's where I am.	0
O_K. So, uh, what do you need to do?	0
Can you give me a description of the Powder-Tower, at the Hindelberg castle?	0
Yeah, in order to get there you have to take a bus, you've got to take the number forty-two	0
To the town hall station. And then you have to transfer to the funicular train. And take the castle exit and turn right. And after about half a mile you'll see the - the Powder-Tower on your right hand side.	0
O_K. And - How much is it for the train and the bus?	0
Um, you can get a - a transfer on the - on the bus for the train for about uh four marks.	0
That's all you need to do?	0
Mm-hmm, thanks for your help.	0
I thought it was a recording.  @@  At first I thought it was like a recording that could pick up what you're saying and give you directions.	0
But it was a real person.	0
"Did I call Europe?"  So,  this  is it.	0
Well, if we - we um	0
We had  her  fooled in the beginning. She thought it was a recording in the beginning and was surprised that a human came on.	0
Um, maybe she had some doubts  later  on whether the  first  part was a recording or not, but while she was  speaking  to it, she didn't.	0
So, are - are you trying to record this meeting?	0
There was a strange reflex.	0
I have a headache. I'm really sort of out of it. O_K, the uh	0
lessons learned.  The reading needs to be shorter. Five minutes is just too long.	1
that was already anticipated by  some  people suggested that if we just have bullets here, they're gonna not - they're - subjects are probably not gonna - going to follow the order. And uh  she  did not. She - No. She - she jumped around quite a bit.	1
S- so if you just number them "one", "two", "three" it's	1
Yeah, and make it sort of clear in the uh -	0
Um. We need to - So that's one thing. And we need a better introduction for the wizard. That is something that Fey actually thought of a - in the last second that sh- the system should introduce  itself,  when it's called.	1
And um, um, another suggestion, by  Liz,  was that we uh, through subjects, switch the tasks. So when - when they have task-one with the computer, the next person should have task-one with a human, and so forth. So we get nice um data for that.	1
Um, we have to refine the tasks more and more, which of course we haven't done at all, so far,	1
in order to avoid this  rephrasing,  so where, even though w- we don't tell the person "ask  blah-blah-blah-blah-blah"	1
they  still  try, or at least  Litonya  tried to um	0
Say exactly what's on there? Yeah.	0
repeat  as much of that text as possible.	0
And uh my suggestion is of course we - we keep the wizard, because I think she did a wonderful job, in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not	1
asked for, "How much is a t- a bus ticket and a transfer" so this is gonna happen all the time, we d- you can never be sure.	0
Um. Johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard.  So um.	0
Yes. I wasn't - wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for	0
There's no female equivalent of -	0
No, I don't know.  Not that I know of.	0
Well, there is witch and warlock, and uh -	0
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, but -	0
Yeah, that's so  @@ .	0
So, some - some work needs to be done, but I think we can uh -	0
And this, and - in case no - you hadn't seen it, this is what Litonya  looked  at during the uh -	0
um while taking the -	0
while partaking in the data	0
So  first of all, I agree that um we should hire Fey, and start paying her. Probably pay for the time she's put in as well.	0
Um, do you know exactly how to do that, or is uh Lila - I mean, you know what exactly do we do to - to put her on the payroll in some way?	0
I'm completely clueless, but I'm willing to learn.	0
O_K. Well, you'll have to. Right. So anyway, um	0
So why don't you uh ask Lila	0
and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in	0
Student-type worker, or - ?	0
Well, yeah she's un- she's not a - a student, she just graduated but anyway. So i- if - Yeah, I agree, she sounded fine, she	0
a- actually was  uh, more	0
uh, present and stuff than - than she was in conversation, so she did a  better  job than I would have guessed from just	0
talking to her. So I think that's great.	0
This is sort of what I  gave  her, so this is for example h- how to get to the student prison, and I  didn't  even spell it out here and in some cases I - I spelled it out a little bit um	0
more thoroughly, this is the information on - on the low- sunken castle, and the amphitheater that never came up,	0
and um, so i- if we give her even more um, instruments to work with I think the results are gonna be even better.	0
Oh, yeah, and then of course as she does it she'll - she'll learn  @@ . So that's great. Um	1
And also if she's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful.	1
she's - actually she's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm, so I think this is all just fine in terms of h- her learning things she's gonna need to know	0
uh, to do her career. So, I - my guess is she'll be r- r- quite happy to take on that job. And, so -	0
Yep. Yeah she - she  didn't  explicitly state that so.	0
And um I told her that we gonna um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s- look for the potential sources to find people.	1
She also agrees that you know if it's all just gonna be students the data is gonna be less valuable because of that so.	1
Well,  as I say  there is this s- set of people next door, it's not hard to	0
However, we may run into a problem with a  reading  task there.	0
Yeah. We could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there's a task, pays ten bucks or something, but	1
you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff. And - and there'll probably be self-selection to some extent.	1
Now,  I signed us up for the Wednesday slot,	1
and part of what we should do is this. So,	1
my idea on that was	1
uh, partly we'll talk about system stuff for the  computer  scientists, but partly I did want it to get the  linguists  involved	1
in some of this issue about what the  task  is and	1
all - um you know, what the  dialogue  is, and what's going on  linguistically,	1
because to the extent that we can get  them   contributing,	1
you know re-formulating things, maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they'll  help  us with it,	0
uh,  other  linguists, if you're a linguist, but in any case, um,	0
the linguistics students and stuff.	0
So my idea on - on Wednesday is  partly	0
to uh - you - I mean, what you did today would - i- is just  fine.  You just uh do "this is what we did, and here's the  thing, and here's s- some of the dialogue and - and	1
But then, the  other  thing of course is we should	0
um give the  computer  scientists some idea of - of	0
what's going on with the  system  design, and where we think [MASK]  fit in and where the  pieces  are and stuff like that.	0
Is - is this  make sense to everybody? Yeah.	0
So, I don't - I don't think it's worth	0
a lot of work, particularly on  your  part, to - to - to make a big presentation. I don't think you should -	0
you don't have to make  any  new  uh PowerPoint or anything. I think we got  plenty  of stuff	0
just see how a discussion goes.	0
other two things is um	0
can have Johno tell us a little about this	0
and we also have a l- little bit on the interface, [MASK] and then um that was  it,  I think.	0
So, what I did for this - this is - uh, [MASK] because	1
I was - I - I took - I tried to	0
conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out - so what I did was I took - I made these dummy nodes called [MASK] that	0
would isolate the things related to the trajector. And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal.	0
And I separated them out. And then I um did similar things for our - our net to - uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot,	0
um, so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the - the  top  layer.	0
And then the bottom layer is just [MASK]	0
So, let's - let's - Yeah, I don't understand it. Let's go -	0
Slide all the way up so we see what the p- the p-	0
very  bottom  looks like, or is  that  it?	0
Yeah, there's just one more node and it says [MASK] which is the decision between the -	0
O_K, great. Alright. So -	0
So basically all I did was I took [MASK]	1
and I grouped things according to what - how I thought they would fit in to	1
uh  [MASK] that would be related. And the two that I came up with	1
And then I said well, uh [MASK] would be the person in this case probably.	1
you know, we have - we have the concept of what their intention was, whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever,	1
or they were hurried.  That's  kind of related to  that.  And then um	1
in terms of the source, the things - uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether -	0
Oh actually, I kind of, - I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one but	0
uh whether the - where I'm  currently  at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether -	0
or the "landmark-iness" of where I'm  currently  at. And "usefulness" is basi- basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that's not -	0
something that you'd visit for tourist's - tourism's sake or whatever.	0
"Travel constraints" would be something like	0
you know, maybe they said they can - they only wanna take a  bus  or something like that, right?	0
And then those are somewhat related to the path, so that would	0
determine whether we'd - could take - we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly.	0
Similar things as the  source  except they also added whether the entity was closed and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination.	0
and then if you go up,	0
in terms of Context, what we had currently said was	1
whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other	1
Um, Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee, or something along those lines.	1
Uh, [MASK] I don't really - I'm not really sure wh	1
so I just made up you know whether - whether what they say is - or h-  how  they say it	0
Um, the Parse would be what verb they chose, and then maybe how they modified it, in the sense of	1
whether they said "I need to get there quickly" or whatever.	1
And um, in terms of World Knowledge, this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things, the time of day it is, and whatnot.	1
Tourbook? That would be, I don't know, the "landmark-iness" of things,	0
whether it's in the  tourbook  or not.	0
Now.    Alright, so I understand what's -	0
I don't yet understand  how you would  use  it. So let me see if I can ask	0
Well, this is not a working [MASK]	1
No, I  understand  that, but - but um	0
Let's slide back up again and see - start at the - at the  bottom  and	0
go ahead, you were about to go up there and  point  to something.	0
Well I - O_K, I just - Say what you were gonna say. O_K.	0
Good, do it! No no, go do it.	0
Uh - I - I'd -	0
No, I was gonna wait until -	0
Oh,  O_K . So, so if you - if we made - if we wanted to make it into a - [MASK]	0
that is, you know, with fill - you know, actually f- uh, fill it  @@  in, then uh -	0
So we'd have to get rid of  this	0
and connect these things directly to [MASK]	0
Well, I don't - That's an issue. So, um -	0
Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise.	0
And - and uh - Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today - is, if we just  do  this, we could wind up with a  huge	1
[MASK]	1
Well I - oh yeah, I unders- I understand  that,  I just - uh it's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that.	1
Well, i- But  that's  what we have to  do.	0
There - there are a variety of ways of doing it.	0
Uh. Let me just mention something that I  don't  want to pursue today which is	1
there are  technical  ways of doing it, uh I- I slipped a paper to Bhaskara	1
and - about [MASK] and	1
uh sort of back off on the purity of [MASK]	0
so. If you co- you could ima- and I- now I don't	0
know  that any of those actually  apply  in this case, but there is some technology you could try to apply.	0
So it's possible that we could do something like [MASK] of some sort that -	0
So in  that  case, the sum- we'd have - we - I mean, these wouldn't be [MASK] We'd hav	0
So what I was gonna  say  is - is maybe a good at this point	0
try to  informally  - I mean, not necessarily in th- in this  meeting,	1
but to try to  informally  think about what the decision variables  are.	1
So, if you have some bottom line	0
uh decision about which  mode,	1
you know,  what  are the most relevant  things.	1
And the  other  trick, which is not a  technical  trick, it's kind of a  knowledge  engineering trick,	1
is to make the n-  each node sufficiently narrow	1
that you don't get this combinatorics. So	1
that you could characterize the decision as a trade-off between three factors, whatever they may be,	0
O_K? then you could say "Aha, let's have  these   three  factors",	0
O_K? and maybe a binary version f- for each, or	0
decision node just  above  the final one.	1
And  then  the question would be if - if  those  are the things that you  care  about,	1
uh can you make a  relatively  compact way of getting	1
from the various  inputs  to the things you  care  about.	1
so that, you know, you can sort of try to do [MASK]	0
given  that we're not gonna screw with the	0
technology  and just always use	0
uh sort of orthodox  [MASK]  then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of	0
how do we  do  that.	0
So what I kind of need to do is to take  this  one and the  old  one and merge them together? So that -	0
uh,  Robert  has thought about this problem f- for a long time, cuz he's had these examples	0
kicking around, so he may have some good intuition	0
you know, what  are  the crucial things.	0
I understand where this - the uh -	0
this is a way of	0
playing with this abs- [MASK] and - and sort of sh- displaying it in a particular way.	0
I don't think our friends	0
uh on Wednesday are going to be able to -	0
Well,  maybe  they will. Well, let me think about whether - whether I think we can present this to them or  not.	0
Well, I think this is still, I mean,	0
ad-hoc. This is sort of th- the second	0
version and I - I - I - look at this maybe just as a,	0
you know, a - a - whatever, U_M_L diagram or, you know, as just a uh screen shot,	0
not really as [MASK] as John - Johno said.	0
We could actually, y- yeah draw it in a different way,	0
in the sense that it would make it more abstract.	0
the - the nice thing is that you know, it just	1
is a - is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple-	1
clearly have to be specified m- more carefully and uh	1
Alright, well, le- let me think about this some more,	1
and uh see if we can	1
to this  linguists  group that - that is  helpful  to  them.	1
ultimately we - we may w- w-	0
we regard this as sort of an exercise in -	0
in thinking about the problem	0
and maybe a first version of uh	0
a  module,  if you wanna call it that, that you can ask,	0
that you can give input and it- it'll uh throw the dice for you,	0
uh throw the die for you,  because um	1
I integrated this into [MASK] in - in the same way as	1
much the same way we can um	1
sort of have this uh -	1
So if this is what [MASK] um	0
will  look  like and what it'll  give  us,	0
um - And a very simple thing. We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere, which is some type of object, to someplace.	0
And this - these uh - this changed now  only  um,	0
It's doing it twice now because it already did it once.	0
Um, we'll add some action type, which in this case is "Approach"	0
and could be, you know, more refined uh	0
in many ways. Or we can uh	0
have something where the uh	0
goal is a public place	0
and it will give us then of course an action type of the type "Enter".	0
So this is just based on this one -	0
and that's - that's about all you can do.	0
And so in the f- if this pla- if the object type	0
um here is - is a m- is a landmark,	0
of course it'll be um [MASK]	0
this is about as much as we can  do	0
if we don't w- if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify	0
"O_K, if it's  this  and  this  but  that  is not the case", and so forth, it just gets really really messy.	0
O_K, I'm sorry. You're - you're -	0
It was  much  too quick for me.	0
O_K, so let me see if I understand what you're saying.	0
So, I - I  do  understand that	1
uh you can take [MASK] and	1
add not - and it w-	1
and you  need  to do this, for sure, we have to add, you know, not too much about	1
and what I  think  you did	1
is add some rules  of the style that are already  there  that say	1
"If it's of type "Landmark", then you	1
take - you're gonna take a picture of it."	1
F- full stop, I mean, that's what you do.	0
Ev- every landmark you take a picture of,	0
Every public place you enter, and statue you want to go as near as possible.	0
and certainly you can add rules like that to	0
And you just did, right? O_K.	0
And it - it would do us no good. That - Ultimately.	1
Well.  So, s- well, and let's think about this.	0
that's a - that's another kind of baseline case, that's another sort of thing "O_K,	1
here's a - another kind of minimal	1
uh way of tackling this".	1
Add extra properties, a deterministic rule for every property you have an action, [MASK]	1
Um,  then  the question would be	0
Now, if that's  all  you're doing,	0
then you can get the types from [MASK]	0
that's all - you're - all you're  using  is this type - the types in the ontology and you're  done.	0
Right? So we don't - we don't use the  discourse,  we don't use the  context,  we don't do  any  of those things.	0
but that's O_K, and I mean it- it's again a kind of	0
And that's something the uh	0
[MASK]  themselves  would - they'd say "Sure, that's no problem - you know, no problem to add types to the ont-" Right?	0
No. And this is - just in order to exemplify what - what we can do very, very easily is, um we have	0
uh interface and we have	0
the rules that are as banal as  of  we just saw, and we have our content. Now, the content -	0
I - whi- which is sort of what - what we see  here,  which is sort of [MASK] whatever. This will	0
um be um a job to find ways of writing down	0
[MASK] in some - some form,	0
and have this be in a - in a - in the content, loosely called [MASK]	0
And the  rules  we want to throw away  completely.	1
And um - and here is exactly where what's gonna be replaced with [MASK] which is exactly getting the input feeding into here.  This  decides	1
whether it's an- whether action - the - [MASK]	0
Uh, " approach ", you called it, I think  this  time.	0
Approach um construction should be activated,	0
That's what you  said  - Yeah, that's fine.	0
Right. But it's  not   construction  there, it's  action.	0
Construction  is a d- is a different story.	0
Right. This is uh - so what we'd be generating would be	0
a reference to a semantic	0
uh like parameters for the -	0
For - for - for -	0
So that - that uh i- if you had the	1
[MASK] and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones, then you would have to supply the parameters.	1
uh, although we haven't worried about this yet, you might wanna worry about something that would	0
and use that to actually get	0
you know, detailed route planning. So, you know, where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that.	0
not - It's not the  immediate  problem.	0
But, presumably that - that - that functionality's there when - when we -	0
So the immediate problem is just deciding w-	1
Aspects of [MASK] to add.	1
Yeah, so the pro- The  immediate  problem is - is back t- t- to what you were - what you are doing with [MASK] You know,	1
uh what are we going to use to make this decision -	1
Right and then, once we've made the decision, how do we put that into the content?	0
Right. Well,  that  -  that  actually is relatively  easy  in this  case.	1
we decide what we want to  use,  how are we gonna  get  it?	1
And  that  the - the -  that's  the hardest problem. So, the  hardest  problem is	0
how are you going to  get  this information	0
from some combination of the -	0
what the person says and the context and [MASK]	0
So, I think that's the hardest problem at the moment is - is	0
where are you gonna - how are you gonna g-  get  this information.	0
Um, and that's - so, getting back to here, uh, we have a d- a technical problem with [MASK] that we - we	1
don't want all the com-	1
There's just too many factors right now.	0
too many factors if we - if we allow them to just go combinatorially.	1
So we wanna think about which ones we really care about	0
and what they  really  most depend on, and can we c- you know, clean this - this up to the point where it -	0
So what we really wanna do i- cuz this is really just [MASK]	0
make it - expand it out into more layers basically?	0
I mean that - that's certainly one thing we can do. Uh, it's true that	0
the way you have this,	0
a lot of the times you have -	0
what you're having is the  values  rather than the  variable.	0
So instead of in- instead it should really be - just be "intention" as a node instead of [MASK]	0
Yeah, right, and then it would have values, uh, "Tour", "Business", or uh "Hurried".	0
But then - but i- it still some knowledge design to do, about i- how do you wanna break this up, what really matters.	0
You know, we have to - it's - it's iterative. We're gonna have to work with it some.	0
I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have	0
a business intention and a touring intention and	0
both of them happening at the same time -	0
Well, you - you could  do  that. And it's perfectly O_K  to uh insist that - that, you know,  th-	0
um, they add up to  one,	0
but that there's uh - that - that it doesn't have to be one zero  zero.	0
O_K. So you could have the conditional p-	0
each  of these things is gonna be a - a - a  probability.	0
So whenever there's a choice,	0
so like  landmark-ness  and  usefulness,  O_K -	0
Well, see I don't think  those  would be mutually -	0
it seems like something could both be -	0
And so that you might want to then have those b-	0
Th- Then they may have to be separate. They may not be able to be values of the same	0
So that's - but again, this is - this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through.	0
Yeah, this is just more	0
me taking last - the last one, and saying "how can I formalize this?"  @@	0
It's - you know, it's great - is - is, you know, as one step toward uh -	0
toward where we wanna go.	0
Also it strikes me that we - we m- may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a -	0
uh, a specification for some interface, here that um	0
takes [MASK] looks at it. Then we discu	0
um the fact that we can pretend we have one, make a dummy until we get the  real  one,	0
and so um we -	0
we  may  wanna decide we can do this from here, but we also could do it um	0
you know if we have a - a - [MASK]	0
So [MASK] takes as input, a vector, right?	1
And um it- Output is whatever,	0
But this information is just [MASK]	0
and then we want to look up some more stuff in [MASK] and we want to look up some more stuff	1
in the - maybe we want to ask the real world, maybe you want to look something up in [MASK] but also we definitely want to	1
look up in the dialogue history um some s- some stuff. Based on we - we have uh - I was just made some examples from the ontology	1
and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a - a - a building and it has doors and stuff like this, but it is also an institution, so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth	0
and we get relations out of it and once we  have  them, we can use  that  information to look in the dialogue history, "were any of  these  things that - that are part of the town hall as an  institution  mentioned?", "were any of these that make the town hall a  building  mentioned?",	0
and so forth, and maybe draw some inferences on that. So this may be a - a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector, that we feed into [MASK] and then -	1
Yeah. I think that's - I think that's exactly right.	1
There  will  be  rules,  but they aren't rules that come to final  decisions,  they're rules that gather information for a decision process.	1
Yeah, no I think that's - that's just fine.	0
Uh,  yeah.  So they'll - they - presumably there'll be	0
a thread or process or something that "Agent",	0
yeah, "Agent", whatever you wan- wanna say, yeah,	0
that uh is rule-driven, and can - can uh -	0
can do things like that. And um there's an issue about whether there will be - that'll be the  same  agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries  out  the decision, so it probably  will.	0
My guess is it'll be the same basic agent that um	1
can go off and get information,	1
run it through a - a c- [MASK] that -	1
turn a crank in [MASK] that'll come out with s-	0
uh more - another vector,	0
at what we would call [MASK] So you now know what you're gonna do and	1
that may actually involve getting  more  information. So on- once you pull that out, it could be that that says "Ah! Now that we know that we gonna go ask [MASK] something else."	1
O_K? Now that we  know  that it's a  bus  trip,	0
O_K? we didn't - We didn't need to know beforehand, uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever, but - but now that	0
we  know  that's the way it's coming out then we gotta go find out more. So I think that's O_K.	0
So this is actually, s- if - if we  were  to build something that	0
and, uh, I had one more thing,	0
it needs to do -	0
I think we - I - I can come up with a - a code for a module that we call [MASK]	1
which does nothing, but it looks  of [MASK] and decides how - are there parts missing that need to be filled out, there's - this is maybe something that this module can do, something that this module can do and then collect	1
recombine them and put them together.	1
So maybe this is actually some - some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it,	0
get this part, then. Yeah.	0
not completely comfortable with the overall story. Um.	0
i- This - this is not a complaint, this is a promise to do more work.	0
So I'm gonna hafta think about it some more. Um.	0
see what we'd  like  to do,	0
and - and this has been implicit in the discussion,	0
do  this in such a way that you get a lot of  re-use.	0
So. What you're trying to get out of this [MASK]	1
is the fact that w- if you know about [MASK]  all this sort of stuff,	1
that a  lot  of this is the  same,	1
for different tasks. And that -	1
uh there's - there's some - some important generalities that you're  getting,  so that you  don't  take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re- do  it.	1
And I don't  yet  see how that  goes.	1
There're no primitives upon which  uh yeah.	0
What are the primitives, and how do you break this -	0
So I y- I'm just -	0
just there saying eee  well you - I know how to do any  individual  case,	0
right? but I  don't  yet - see what's the  really  interesting question is can you use uh [MASK]	0
uh [MASK]  to  get powerful generalizations.	0
Maybe we sho- should we a- add then the "what's this?"	0
I mean, we have to "how do I get to X_".	0
Then we also have the "what's this?" domain,	0
where we get some slightly different -	0
Um  Johno,  actually, does not allow us to call them "intentions" anymore. So he - he dislikes the term.	0
Well, I -  I  don't like the term  either,  so I have n-  i-  uh	0
i- i- y- w- i- i-	0
But um, I'm sure the "what's this?" questions also create some interesting [MASK]	0
Could be. I'm not a - I'm not op- particularly opposed to adding that or any other task, I mean, eventually we're gonna want a whole range of them.	0
I'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this. I just at the moment don't know. H-	0
Do you mean in the sense of "is there a way we can generalize [MASK]", or -	0
No. Well, no the Bayes - [MASK] -	0
Seems like it has to be specific.	0
[MASK] will be dec- specific for each decision. But what I'd like to be able to do	1
is to have the way that you [MASK]	1
that will go into [MASK] be	1
So that if you have sources, you have [MASK] and stuff like that, and there's a language for  talking  abou	1
you  shouldn't  have to do that  differently	1
for uh uh going to something, than for circling it, for uh telling someone else how to go there,  whatever  it is.	1
So that - that, the -	0
the  decision  processes are gonna be different	0
What you'd  really  like of course is the same thing you'd  always  like which is that you have	1
um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o- over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs.	1
So all sorts of different tasks	0
and all sorts of different ways of  expressing  them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going  on.	0
that's - that would be the really  pretty  result.	0
pushing it one step further, when you get to [MASK] and stuff, what you'd like to be able to do is say you have this  parser  which is much fancier than the parser that comes with	0
uh [MASK] i- that - that actually  uses  constructions and is able to tell  from  this  construction	0
that there's uh something about the intent - you know, the actual what people wanna do or what they're referring to and stuff,	0
whether it - about - what is this or where is it or something,	0
that you could tell  from  the construction, you could pull out [MASK] which you're gonna use in a general  way.	0
Somehow you'd know that you needed to find out whether there - something was a landmark or something like that?	0
You might be able to - to uh	0
say that this i- this is the  kind  of construction	0
there's - Let's say there's a uh cont-	0
there - the - the land-	0
the construction  implies  the there's a con- this thing is being viewed as a  container.	0
So just from this local construction	0
you know that you're gonna  hafta  treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information. And that may effect the way you process everything else.	0
So if you say "how do I get  into  the castle"	0
Or,  you know, "what  is  there in the castle" or - so there's all sorts of things you might ask	0
that involve the castle as a  container	0
and you'd  like  to have this  orthogonal  so that  anytime  the castle's referred to as a container,	0
you crank up the appropriate stuff.	0
Independent of what the  goal  is, and independent of what the surrounding  language  is.	0
Alright, so that's - that's the - that's the thesis level uh -	0
It's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its [MASK]	0
because they're really fancy then, in - in -	0
for these kinds of analysis.	0
Well, you have prepositional phrases that -	0
Yeah, but they're - they're easier for  parsers.  Parsers can pick those up but - but the - with [MASK]	0
they have a tough time. Because the -	0
mean- the semantics are very complex in that.	0
I had one more  thing. I don't remember. I just forgot it again.	0
Oh yeah, b- But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to - to throw this away and - and replace it with something else, or whatever, so that we have - so that this is sort of the representational formats we're - we're - we're talking about that are independent of the problem,	1
that generalize over those problems, and are	1
oh, t- of a higher quality than an- any actual whatever um	1
"X_" that we may use for the decision making,	1
So, are we gonna be meeting  here  from now on? I'm - I'm happy to  do  that. We - we had  talked  about it, cuz you have th- th- the display and everything, that seems fine.	0
Yeah, um, Liz also asks whether we're gonna have presentations  every  time. I don't think we will  need  to do that but it's - so far I think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and - and -	0
Oh yeah. No I -	0
I think it's worth it	0
to ass- to meet here	0
to bring this, and assume that something may come  up  that we wanna look at.	0
Yeah, that was my -	0
She was  good.  Litonya was  good.	0
Yeah? The uh - um, she w- she was  definitely  good in the sense that she - she showed us some of the weaknesses	0
the fact that she was a  real  subject you know, is - is -	0
Yeah, and - and - and - yeah and - and she took it seriously and stuff l- No, it was great.	0
So  I  think that um - I mean, w- Looking - just  looking  at this data,  listening  to it, what can we get out of it in terms of  our  problem,	0
for example, is, you know,	0
she actually m- said - you know,	0
she never s- just spoke about entering, she just wanted to get someplace, and she said for buying stuff.	0
So this is definitely interesting, and -	0
Um, and in the other case, where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti,	0
also,  of course, not in the sentence "How do you  get  there?" was pretty standard.	0
except that there was [MASK]	0
for pointing at what she talked about  before,  and there she was talking about looking at  pictures  that are painted inside a  wall-  on walls, so	0
Actually, you'd need a lot of world knowledge. This would have been a classical um uh [MASK] actually. Um,	0
because graffiti is usually found on the  outside  and not on the  inside,  but	0
So the mistake  would have make a mistake - the system would have made a mistake here.	0
