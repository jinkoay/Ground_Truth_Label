O_K, so uh  had some interesting mail from uh Dan Ellis. Actually, I think he - he	1
redirected it to everybody  also  so uh  [MASK] uh have a  big  bunch of energy at - at uh five hertz  uh	0
where this came up was that uh I was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web and -	1
and uh  I just sort of hadn't noticed this, but that - the major, major component in the wave - in the  second  wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner.	1
So.  So. I   I have to be more careful about using that as a - as a -	1
uh, in fact it's  not,	1
of the effects of room reverberation. It is- isn't a bad illustration of the effects of uh room  noise.	1
So. And then we had this other discussion about um	0
whether this affects the dynamic  range,  cuz I know, although we start off with thirty two bits, you end up with uh  sixteen  bits and	0
you know, are we getting hurt there? But uh Dan is pretty confident that we're  not,  that - [MASK] is not - is  still  not a significant	0
So there was a question of whether we should  change  things here, whether we should  change a capacitor on the input box for that or whether we should	0
Yeah, he suggested a smaller capacitor, right? [MASK]	0
Right. But then I had some other uh thing- discussions with him and the feeling was  once we start monk- monkeying with that, uh, many other problems could ha- happen.	0
And additionally we - we already have a lot of data that's been collected with  that,  so.	0
A  simple  thing to do is he - he - he has a - I forget if it - this was in that mail or in the following mail, but he has a - a simple filter, a digital filter that he suggested.	0
We just run over the data before we deal with it.	0
um The  other  thing that  I  don't know the answer to, but when [MASK] here,	1
uh whether they're using it with the high-pass filter option or not.	1
I don't know if anybody  knows.  But.	0
Yeah. So when we're doing all these things using our software there  is  -	1
um if it's - if it's based on [MASK]	0
uh there is an option there which then comes up through to [MASK] which	0
um allows you to do high-pass filtering and in  general  we like to  do  that,  because  of things like this and	1
it's - it's pretty - it's not a very severe	1
filter.  Doesn't affect speech frequencies, even pretty low speech frequencies, at  all,  but it's	1
What's the  cut-off frequency it used?	0
Oh.  I don't know I wrote this a while ago	0
Something  like that. Yeah. I mean I think there's some effect above twenty but it's - it's - it's - it's mild.	0
So, I mean it probably - there's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it's - it's pretty mild.	0
I don't know in the - in [MASK] of the stuff is there a high-pass filter or a pre- pre-emphasis or something in the -	0
Uh. I think we use a pre-emphasis. Yeah.	0
So. We - we - we want to go and check that in i- for anything that we're going to use [MASK] for.	1
uh He says that there's a pretty good roll off in [MASK] so	0
we don't need - need to worry about them one way or the other but if we  do  make use of the cheap mikes,	1
uh we want to be sure to do that - that filtering before we	1
process it. And then again if it's	1
uh depending on the option that the - our - our software is being run with, it's - it's quite possible that's already being taken care of.	0
uh But I also have to pick a different picture to show the effects of reverberation.	0
Did somebody notice it  during  your talk?	0
uh  Well.  If they made output they were - they were, you know - they were nice.	0
I mean the  thing  is it was	1
since I was  talking  about reverberation and  showing  this thing that was  noise,  it wasn't a good  match,  but it  certainly  was still uh an indication of the fact that you get	1
uh It's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it's a noise that we definitely know what to do.	0
So, I mean, it doesn't take deep -	0
a new - bold new methods to get rid of uh five hertz noise, so.	0
uh But. So it was - it was a bad example in  that  way, but it's - it  still  is - it's the  real   thing  that we  did  get out of the  microphone  at distance, so it wasn't	0
it w- it w- wasn't wrong it was inappropriate.  So.	0
Yeah, someone noticed it later pointed it out to me, and I went "oh, man. Why didn't I notice that?"	0
So I think we'll change our - our  picture  on the web, when we're  @@ .	1
One of the things I was - I mean, I was trying to think about what - what's the best	0
way to show the difference an- and I had a couple of thoughts one was,	0
that  spectrogram  that we show	0
is O_ K,  but the thing is	0
the eyes uh and the  the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns	0
that in first glance you look at them it doesn't seem like it's that bad	0
uh because there's  many  features that are still  preserved.	0
So one thing to do might be to just take a  piece  of the spec- uh of the spectrogram where you can see	0
that  something  looks  different,  an- and blow it up, and have  that  be the part that's - just to show as  well.  You know.	0
i- i-  Some  things are going to be hurt.	0
Another,  I was thinking of was um	1
like uh - like we look at with the recognizer,	0
and look at [MASK] that you get out of there,	1
and the - the uh, um,	0
the reverberation uh  does  make it -  does   change  that. And so maybe - maybe that would be more obvious.	0
W- w- what d- what do you mean?	0
all the recognizers look at frames. So they - they look at -	1
So like one instant in time.	0
Yeah, look at a -	0
So it's, yeah, at  one  point in time or uh twenty - over twenty milliseconds or something,	1
you have [MASK]  That's  what I meant by a slice. Yeah. And	1
You  could  just - you  could  just throw up, you know, uh	0
if you look at -	0
the uh - some [MASK]	0
You know, one from one, one from the  other,  and then, you know, you can look and see how different the numbers are.	0
Right.  Well, that's why I saying either   Well, either [MASK] but -  but I think the thing is you wanna -	0
I don't mean a graph. I mean the actual  numbers.	0
Oh.   That  would be lovely, yeah.	0
Yeah. "See how different these  sequences of numbers are?"	0
Or  I could just add them up and get a different  total.	0
Uh. What else - wh- what's - what  else  is going on?	0
Yeah, at  first  I had a remark why - I am wondering why [MASK] is always so far. I mean we are always meeting at the	0
beginning of the table and	0
Uh. I guess cuz we haven't wanted to  move  it.	0
We - we could -  we could move  us,  and.	0
Uh. Since the last meeting we've - we've tried to put together um  the clean low-pass um downsampling, upsampling, I mean,	1
Uh the new filter that's replacing [MASK]	1
and also  the um delay issue so that -	0
We considered th- the - the delay issue on the - for [MASK] Mmm.	0
So we've put together all  this  and then we have results that are not um	1
very impressive. Well, there is no  real  improvement.	1
But it's not wer- worse and it's better - better latency, right?	1
Well. Actually it's better. It seems better when we look at the mismatched case but  I think we are like - like cheated here by the - th- this problem that	1
uh in some cases when you modify slight - slightly modify the initial condition you end up	1
completely somewhere air- somewhere else in the - in the space,  the parameters. So.	1
Well. The other system are for instance. For Italian is at seventy-eight  percent recognition rate on the mismatch,  and this new system has eighty-nine.	0
I don't think it indicates something, really.	0
I don't - I don't think it means that the new system is more robust or -	1
Well, the test would be if you then tried it on one of the other test sets, if -	0
Right. So this was Italian, right?	0
Yeah. Yeah. It's similar for other  test  sets but I mean	1
So then if you take your changes and then -	0
from this se- seventy-eight um percent recognition rate  system,	1
I could change the transition probabilities for the - [MASK] and  it will end up to eighty-nine also.	1
By using point five instead of point six, point four  as in the - [MASK]	1
Yeah. Yeah I looked at um -  looked at the results when Stephane  did  that and it's - it's really wo- really happens.   I mean th- the only difference is you change the self-loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent  and it causes ten percent difference in the word  error  rate.	1
A  tenth  of a per  cent.	0
Even tenth of a percent?	0
Well, we tried - we tried point one, yeah.	0
I - I'm sorry f- for point - from - You change at point one  and n- not tenth of a percent, one tenth,  alright ?  Um so from point five - so from point six to point  five  and you get ten percent better.	1
And it's -  I think it's what you basically hypothesized in the last meeting  about uh it just being very - and I think you mentioned this in your email too - it's just very um -  you know get stuck in some local minimum and this thing throws you out of it I guess.	1
Well, what's - what are - according to the rules what - what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities? Are they supposed to be point  five  or point  six?	1
I think you're not allowed to -	1
Yeah. That's supposed to be point six,	1
Point - It's  supposed  to be point six.	0
But changing it to point  five  I think is -  which gives you much better results, but that's  not allowed.	1
But not allowed?  Yeah.  O_K .	0
Yeah, but  even  if you use point  five,  I'm not  sure  it will	1
always give you the  better   results   on other test set or it	1
Right. We only tested it on the - [MASK] right? You said on the  other  cases you didn't notice -	1
on the other  training  set, I mean.	0
I think, yeah. I think the reason is, yeah, I not- I -	0
it was in my mail I think also,	0
is the fact that the mismatch	0
only on the far microphone.	0
Well, in - for [MASK] everything is um using the far microphone training and testing,	0
whereas for the highly mismatched, training is done on the close microphone so	0
it's - it's clean speech basically	0
so you don't have this problem of local minima probably	0
and for the well-match, it's a mix of	0
close microphone and distant microphone and -  Well.	0
I  did  notice uh something -	0
So th- I think the mismatch is the more difficult for the  training  part.	0
Somebody, I think it was Morgan, suggested at the last meeting that I actually count to see  how many parameters and how many frames.	1
And there are uh almost one point eight million  frames  of training data	1
and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system.	1
So it's very, very  few  parameters compared to how much training data.	0
Well. Yes. So. And that - that says that we could have lots more parameters actually.	1
Yeah. Yeah. I did one quick experiment just to make sure I had everything worked out and I just -	0
uh f- for most of the um -	0
For - for all of the  digit  models, they end up at three mixtures per state.	1
And so I just did a  quick  experiment, where I changed it so it went to four	1
it - it didn't have a r- any significant effect at the uh [MASK] and it had -  it was just barely significant for the well-matched  better.	1
Uh so I'm r- gonna run that again but	1
um with many more uh mixtures per state.	1
Yeah.  Cuz at forty thou- I mean you could you could have uh -	0
Yeah,  easily  four times as many   parameters.	0
And I think also  just seeing what we saw	0
in terms of the expected duration of the silence model? when we did this tweaking of the self-loop?	0
The  silence  model expected duration was  really  different. And so in the case where  um  it had a better  score,  the silence model expected duration was much  longer.  So it was like -  it was a better match. I  think   you know if we	0
make a better silence model I think that will help a lot too  um for a lot of these cases so	0
but one one thing I - I wanted to check out before I increased the um  number of mixtures per state was  uh	1
in their  default training script they do an initial set of three re-estimations	1
and then they built the silence model and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures and they do another seven then they add mixtures	1
then they do a final set of seven and they quit.	1
Seven seems like a lot to me and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time  I mean to do one turn-around of the well matched case takes like a day.	1
And so  you know in trying to run these experiments I notice, you know, it's difficult to find machines, you know, compute the  run  on. And so one of the things I did was [MASK] for the  Linux	1
machines cuz we have this one from I_B_M that's got like five processors in it?	1
and so now I'm - you can run stuff on  that  and that really helps a lot because now we've got	1
you know, extra machines that we can use for  compute.   And if - I'm do- running an experiment right now where I'm changing the number of iterations?  from seven to three? just to see how it affects the baseline system.	1
And so if we can get  away  with just doing  three,  we can do   many  more  experiments  more  quickly.	1
And if it's not a - a  huge  difference from running with  seven  iterations,	1
um, you know, we should be able to get a lot more experiments done.	1
And so. I'll let you know what - what happens with that. But if we can  you know, run all of these  back-ends  f- with many fewer iterations and  on Linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done.	1
So I wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before I  increased the number of Gaussians.	0
So um, how's it going on the -	0
So. You - you did some things. They didn't improve things in a way that convinced you you'd substantially improved anything.	0
But they're  not  making things worse and we have reduced latency, right?	0
um actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well-matched case	0
and we just noticed that - Yeah, actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny. It's not a mean of word error rate. It's not a weighted mean of word error rate, it's a weighted mean of  improvements.	1
So. Which means that  actually the weight on the well-matched is -	1
Well I well what what -	1
What happened is that if you have a small	1
a small if on the well-matched case	1
it will have uh huge influence on the improvement	1
compared to the reference because the reference system is -	1
is - is quite good for -	1
for the well-ma- well-matched case also.	1
So it - it weights the improvement on the well-matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases?	0
No, but it's the weighting of the - of the  improvement  not of the  error  rate.	0
Yeah, and it's  hard  to  improve  on the - on the best  case,  cuz it's already so  good,  right?	0
Yeah but  what I mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the H_ -	0
and this will not affect the final score	0
Uh this will almost not affect the final score because	0
this improvement - because the improvement	0
uh relative to the - the baseline is small -	0
So they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy? rather than word error rate?	1
Uh improvement? No, it's compared to the word er- it's improvement on the word error rate, yeah. Sorry.	1
O_K.  So if you have	1
uh  ten  percent error and you get  five  percent absolute uh  improvement then that's fifty percent.	1
O_K. So what you're saying then is that if it's something that has a small word error rate,	1
then uh a - even a relatively small  improvement  on it, in  absolute  terms,	1
will show up as quite - quite large in this. Is that what you're saying? Yes.	1
O_K. But yeah that's - that's - it's the notion of relative  improvement.	1
Sure, but when we think about the  weighting,  which is point five, point three, point two,	0
on - on  relative  figures,	0
So when we look at this error rate	0
No. That's why I've been  saying  we should be looking at word error rate uh and - and not - not at  at accuracies. It's -	1
I mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through. It's just -	1
I mean, it's not -	0
it's not that  different,  right? I mean, just subtract the accuracy. I mean -	0
Yeah but you're - but when you look at the numbers, your sense of the  relative  size of things is quite different.  If you had ninety percent uh correct  and five percent, five over ninety doesn't look like it's a big difference, but  five over  ten  is - is big.	1
Oh. Oh,  I  see. Yeah.	0
So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and  getting sense of what was important.	0
I see. I see. Yeah.	0
Well anyway uh. So. Yeah. So it hurts a little bit on [MASK]	1
Like, it's difficult to say because again  um   I'm not sure I have the um -	0
Hey Morgan? Do you remember that Signif program that we used to use for testing signi- ? Is that still valid?	0
I - I've been  using  that.	0
Yeah. Yeah, it was actually updated. Uh.	0
Oh, it  was.  Oh, I shoul-	0
Jeff updated it some years ago and - and uh cleaned it up made some things better in it. So.	0
O_K. I should  find  that  new  one. I just use my  old  one from  ninety-two or whatever	0
Yeah, I'm sure it's not  that  different but - but he -  he uh - he was a little more rigorous, as I recall.	0
So it's around, like, point five.	0
uh percent absolute on  Italian  -	1
Out of what? I mean. s-	0
Uh well we start from ninety-four point sixty-four, and we go to ninety-four point O_ four.	1
Uh-huh. So that's six - six point th-	0
Ninety- three  point six four, right? is the  baseline.	0
Oh, the  baseline,  you mean.	0
Well I don't - I'm not talking about the baseline here. I uh -	0
My baseline is the submitted system.	0
For Finnish, we start to ninety-three point eight-four and we go to ninety-three point seventy-four.	1
And for Spanish we are -	1
we were at ninety-five point O_ five and we go to ninety-three-s- point sixty one.	1
O_K, so we  are  getting hurt somewhat. And is that wh- what - do you know what piece - you've done several  changes  here.  Uh, do you know what pie-	1
I guess - I guess it's - it's the filter.	0
well uh we don't have complete result, but the filter -	1
So the filter with the shorter delay hurts on Italian [MASK]	1
And the other things, like um  downsampling, upsampling, don't seem to hurt and	0
I'm  really   confused  about something.	0
If we saw that making a small change like, you know, a tenth, to the  self-loop  had a huge effect,  can we really make any conclusions about	0
differences in this stuff? I mean,  especially  when they're  this   small.  I mean.	0
I think we can be completely  fooled  by this thing, but -	0
So. There is first  this  thing, and then the - yeah, I computed the um -  like, the confidence level on the different	0
And for [MASK] they are around um	0
For the mismatched they are around like let's say one point five percent.	0
And for the well-m- uh [MASK] they are also around one point five.	0
But - O_K, so you - these - these degradations you were talking about were on [MASK]	1
Uh. Do the - does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases?	1
Uh. About the same. It doesn't hurt. Yeah.	0
Doesn't hurt, but doesn't get a little better, or something. No.	1
O_K, so  um I guess the argument one might make is that, "Yeah, if you looked at  one  of these cases  and you jiggle something and it changes  then uh you're not quite sure what to make of it. But when you look across a  bunch  of these and there's some - some pattern,	0
I mean, so eh h- here's all the - if - if in all these different cases  it  never  gets better, and there's significant number of cases where it gets worse,  then you're probably  hurting things,  I would say.	0
So um  I mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with - with a different test set, that you're not jiggling things with.	0
So I guess the question is if you can do  better  than this. If you can - if we can approximate  the old numbers while still keeping the latency down.	0
Uh, so. Um. What I was asking, though, is uh - are - what's - what's the level of communication with uh  [MASK] gang now, about this and -	1
exchanging mail as soon as we -	1
Yeah. For the moment, they are working on integrating	1
Yeah. And so. Yeah. We are working on our side on other things like  uh also trying a sup- [MASK] but	1
of - of our  own,  I mean,  another	1
Yeah. So I think it's - it's O_K. It's going -	0
Is there any further discussion about this - this idea of - of having some sort of source code control?	1
Yeah. Well. For the moment they're -	1
uh everybody's quite um -	1
There is this Eurospeech deadline, so.	1
But yeah. As soon as we have something that's significant and that's better than - than what was submitted,	0
we will fix - fix the system and -	0
But we've not discussed it - it - it -  this  yet, yeah.	0
Yeah.  Sounds like a great idea but - but I think that - that um   he's  saying people are sort of scrambling for a Eurospeech deadline.  But that'll be uh, uh done in a week. So, maybe after   this next one.	1
Wow! Already a week! Man! You're right. That's amazing.	0
Anybo- anybody in the - in this group do- doing anything for Eurospeech? Or, is that what - is that -	0
We are trying to - to do something with the	0
And the good thing is that  there is this first deadline,	0
and, well, some people from [MASK] are working on a paper for this, but there is also	0
special session about [MASK] which is -	0
uh which has an extended deadline. So.	0
The deadline is in May.	0
For uh -  Oh, for Eurospeech?	0
Yeah. So f- only for [MASK] So it - it's good, yeah.	0
Mm-hmm. Where  is  Eurospeech this year?	0
So the deadline - When's the  deadline?	0
I think it's the thirteenth of May.	0
It's great. So we should  definitely  get something in for  that.	0
But on  meeting  digits, maybe there's - Maybe. Maybe.	0
Yeah. So it would be for the first deadline.	0
Yeah. So, I mean, I - I think that you could certainly start looking at - at the issue uh but - but uh  I think it's probably, on s- from what Stephane is saying, it's - it's unlikely to get sort of active participation from the two sides until after they've -	1
Well I could at least -	0
Well, I'm going to be out next week but I could	1
try to look into like this uh [MASK] over the web. That seems to be a very popular	1
people distributing changes and -	1
over, you know, multiple sites and things so maybe	1
if I can figure out how do that easily and then pass the information on to everybody so that it's	1
you know, as easy to do as possible and - and people don't - it won't interfere with  their regular work, then maybe that would be good.	1
And I think we could use it for  other  things around here too. So.	0
That's  cool. And if you're interested in using [MASK] I've set it up here, so.	1
Oh  great.  O_K.  I used it a long time ago but it's been a while so maybe I can ask you some questions.	1
Oh. So. I'll be away tomorrow and Monday but I'll be back on Tuesday or Wednesday.	1
Yeah. Dave, the  other  thing, actually, is - is this business about this wave form. Maybe you and I can talk a little bit at some point about  coming up with a better  uh demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page,  cuz  uh  - the uh  um I mean, actually the - the uh	1
It  made  a good - good  audio  demonstration because when we could  play  that clip the - the - the really   obvious   difference  is that you can hear two voices and -   in the second one and only hear -	1
Maybe we could just  like, talk into a cup.	0
No, I mean, it sound - it sounds pretty reverberant, but I mean you can't - when you play it back in a room with a - you know a big room,  nobody can hear  that  difference really. They hear that it's lower amplitude and they hear there's a second voice, um  but uh that - actually that makes for a perfectly good demo because that's a real obvious thing, that you hear two voices. Yeah.	1
Well that - that -  that's  O_K. But for the - the  visual,  just, you know, I'd like to have uh  uh, you know, the  spectrogram  again, because you're - you're - you're visual  uh  abilities  as a human  being  are so  good   you can pick out - you know, you - you look at the  good  one, you look at the  cru-  the screwed  up  one, and - and you can see the  features  in it without trying to  @@  - yeah.	1
I  noticed  that in the  pictures.  I thought "hey, you know th-" I -	0
My initial thought was "this is not too bad!"	0
Right. But you have to - you know, if you look at it closely, you see "well, here's a place where this one has a big formant - uh uh formant - maj- major formants here are -  are moving quite a bit." And then you look in the other one and they look practically flat.	0
So I mean you could - that's why I was thinking, in a section like  that,  you could take a look - look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say " Oh  yeah. This - this really  distorted  it quite a bit."	0
Yeah. The  main  thing that struck  me  in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies. It looked like  for the one that was farther away, you know, it  really  - everything was attenuated and -	0
I mean  that  was the main visual thing that  I  noticed.	0
But it's - it's uh - So.	0
Yeah. So there are - clearly are spectral effects. Since you're getting all this indirect energy, then a lot of it does have - have uh	0
reduced high frequencies. But um	0
the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed, and -	0
and uh we want to  show  that, in some obvious  way.  The reason I  put  the wave forms  in  there was because	0
uh they - they  do  look quite  different.	0
And so I thought "Oh,  this  is good." but I -  I just uh -	0
After - after uh they were put  in  there I didn't really  look  at them anymore, cuz I just -	0
I want something that has a - is a more interesting explanation for why they're different.	0
Oh. So maybe we can just substitute one of these wave forms and um  then do some kind of	0
zoom in on the spectrogram on an interesting area.	0
The  other  thing that we had in there that I didn't like was that um  the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh when you  listen  to it is that there's a second  voice,	1
and the - the - the - the - the uh  cuts that we  have  there actually don't correspond to the full wave form. It's just the first - I think there was something where he was having some trouble getting so much in, or. I - I forget the reason behind it. But	1
it - it's um -  it's the first six seconds or something  of it and it's in  the seventh or eighth second or something where  @@  the second voice comes in. So we - we would like to actually  see	1
the voice coming in,  too,  I think, since that's the most obvious thing  when you  listen  to it.	1
Uh, yeah. Yeah. I brought some - I don't know if -  some	0
figures here. Well. I start - we started to work on [MASK] And	1
the preliminary results were very bad.	1
So the thing that we did is just to add [MASK]  before	1
this, the  Wall  uh process, which [MASK]	1
And it hurts uh a lot.	1
And so we started to look at - at um things like  this,  which is,	0
So you have [MASK] for	0
And I plotted this for two channels.	0
Channel zero is the close mic- microphone, and channel one is the distant microphone.	0
And it's perfectly synchronized, so.	0
And the sentence contain only one word, which is   "Due"	0
And it can't clearly be seen. Where - where is it? Where is the word?	0
This is - this is, oh, a plot of [MASK] the  energy.	0
This is a plot of [MASK]	0
uh when we don't use [MASK]  and when there is n	0
There is just [MASK] and  and some downsampling, upsampling.	0
[MASK] is the close talking? - uh the close channel? and s- channel one is the -	0
Yeah. So [MASK] is very clean, actually.	0
Uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure,	0
Which is good. Well, the noise part is around zero and -	0
And then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization.	0
What we can clearly see is that on the speech portion	0
the two channel come - becomes very close,	0
but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the variance of the noise is -	0
This is still being a plot of [MASK]	0
Yeah. This is still [MASK]	0
O_K.  Can I ask um what does variance normalization do? w- What is the effect of that?	0
So it - it -	0
It normalized th- the standard deviation. So it -	0
y- Yeah. No, I understand that, but I mean -	0
You - you get an estimate of the standard deviation. That's um -	0
No. No, I understand what it  is,  but I mean, what does it - what's - what is uh -	0
Why - why do it?	0
everything uh - If you have [MASK] everything is based on means and variances.  So if there's an  overall	0
You know, it's like uh if you were doing uh image processing	0
and in some of the pictures you were looking at, uh there was a lot of light	0
uh and - and in some, there was  low  light, you know, you would want to  adjust  for that in order to  compare  things.	0
And the variance is just sort of like the  next  moment, you know? So uh	0
what if um  one  set of pictures was taken uh so that throughout the course it was - went through daylight and night uh  um um  ten  times, another time it went thr- I mean i- is, you know, how - how much -	0
how much vari- Or no. I guess a better example would be	0
how much of the light was coming in from  outside  rather than  artificial  light. So if it was a  lot  -	0
if  more  was coming from outside, then there'd be the bigger effect of the - of the - of the change in the -  So	0
every mean - every - all - all of the - the parameters that you  have,  especially the  variances,  are going to be affected by the  overall  variance.	0
And so, in  principle,  you - if you remove  that  source, then, you know, you can -	0
So would - the major effect is - that you're gonna get is by normalizing the  means,  but it may help -	0
That's the first order but -  thing,  but then the second order is - is the variances	0
First-order  effects. And it  may  help to do the  variance.  O_K. O_K.	0
because, again, if you - if you're trying to distinguish between E_ and B_	0
if it just so  happens  that the E_'s  were a more - you know, were recorded when - when the energy was - was - was larger or something, or the  variation  in it was larger,	0
uh than with the B_'s, then this will be - give you some - some bias. So the -	0
it's removing these sources of variability in the data	0
that have nothing to do with the linguistic component.	0
Gotcha.  O_K . Sorry to interrupt.	0
But the - the uh - but let me as- ask -  ask  you something. i- is - if -	0
And it - and this -	0
If you have a good voice  activity  detector, isn't - isn't it gonna pull that out?	0
Yeah. Sure. If they are good. Yeah.	0
Well what it - it shows is that, yeah,	0
perhaps a good voice activity detector is - is good before [MASK]	0
But uh, yeah, voice activity detection is not   an easy thing neither.	0
But after you do this, after you do the  variance  normalization - I mean.	0
I don't know, it  seems  like  this  would be a lot easier than  this  signal to work with.	0
What I notice is that, while I prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one,	0
well, because you clearly see where speech  is.	0
But the problem is that on the speech portion, channel zero and channel one are more different	0
than when you use variance normalization	0
where channel zero and channel one become closer.	0
But for the purposes of finding the  speech  -	0
Yeah, but  here  - Yeah.	0
You're more interested in the difference between the  speech  and the  nonspeech,  right?	0
Yeah. So I think, yeah.	0
For I th- I think that it - perhaps it shows that	0
uh the parameters that the voice activity detector should use -	0
uh  have  to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition.	0
Yeah. So basically you want to reduce this effect. So you can do that by doing the voi- voice activity detection. You also could do it by spect- uh [MASK]  before  the  variance normalization, right?	0
Yeah, but it's not clear, yeah.	0
We-  So. Well. It's just to the - the number that at- that are here are recognition experiments on Italian [MASK]	0
with these two kinds of parameters. And,	0
it's better with variance normalization.	0
Yeah. Yeah. So it does get better even though it looks ugly. O_K.	0
but does this have the voice activity detection in it?	0
But the fact is that the voice activity detector doesn't work on channel one. So.	0
Where - at what stage is the voice activity detector applied?	0
Is it applied  here  or a- after the variance normalization? or -	0
It's applied before variance normalization. So it's a  good  thing, because	0
I guess voice activity detection on this	0
should - could be worse.	0
Is it applied all the way back  here?	0
It's applied the um on,	0
yeah, something like this, yeah.	0
Maybe  that's  why it doesn't work for channel  one.	0
So we could perhaps do just mean [MASK]	0
Can I ask a, I mean - a sort of top-level question, which is  um "if - if most of what [MASK]	1
folk are working with is trying to  integrate this other - other uh [MASK]  why are we worrying about it?"	1
It's just uh - Well it's another -  They are trying to u- to use the um -	1
the Ericsson and we're trying to use something - something  else.	1
And. Yeah, and also to understand what  happens  because	0
When we do [MASK] actually, I think	0
that this is the - the two last figures.	0
It seems that after [MASK] speech is more emerging now uh	0
than - than  before.  Well,	0
the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the n- spectral subtrac- subtracted noise  portion  is - is  larger.	0
Well, if you compare the first figure to  this  one -	0
Actually the scale is not the  same,  but if you look at the - the numbers um  you clearly see that the difference between [MASK] is  larger.	0
Uh but what happens is that after [MASK]	0
you also increase the variance of this - of [MASK]	0
And so if you apply variance normalization on this, it completely sc- screw	0
So yeah. And what they did at [MASK] is just	1
uh they don't use [MASK] and I think -	1
I think as soon as they will try [MASK]	1
there will be a problem.	1
So yeah, we're working on the same thing but	1
with different - different system and -	1
Right. I mean, i- the	0
Intellectually it's interesting to work on things th- uh one way or the other but I'm - I'm just wondering if um -  on the list of things that there are to do, if there are things that we won't do because  we've got two groups doing the same thing. Um.	1
Just - just asking. Uh. I mean, it's -	1
There  also  could be - I mean. I can  maybe  see a reason f- for both working on it  too  if	0
you know, if - if - if you work on something  else  and - and you're waiting for them to give you	0
I mean it's hard to know whether  the effects that you get from the  other  experiments you do will  carry  over  once you then bring in their spectral subtraction module.	0
So it's - it's almost like everything's held up  waiting  for this  one thing. I don't know if that's  true  or not, but I could see how -	0
Maybe that's what you were thinking.	0
I mean, we  still  evidently have a latency reduction plan which - which isn't quite what you'd like it to be.	0
That - that seems like one prominent thing.	0
And then uh weren't issues of - of having a - a second stream or something?	0
Was it - There was this business that, you know, we - we could use up the full forty-eight hundred bits, and -	0
Yeah.  But I think they'r-	0
I think we want to work on  this.  They also want to work on  this,  so.	0
We - we will try [MASK]	0
I think they want to work on the second stream also, but more with  some kind of multi-band or, well,	0
O_K.  Do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be?  the next uh - In  June.  O_K.	1
Yeah, the other thing is that you saw that - that mail about uh [MASK] performing quite differently?	1
So um. This - there was this experiment of uh "what if we just take the baseline?"   set uh  of features, [MASK]	1
and you inc- incorporate [MASK]	1
And it  looks  like the - [MASK] is actually uh better - significantly better.	1
Yeah but I don't know which [MASK] they use.	1
I th- I think it's on -	0
I think it's easy to do  better  because it doesn't work at  all.	0
I - I don't know which - which one. It's  Pratibha  that - that did this experiment.	1
Um. We should ask which [MASK]	1
He - Actually, I think that he say with [MASK]	1
And the experiment was sometime better, sometime worse.	0
Yeah but I - it's uh - I think you were talking about the  other  mail that used [MASK] on the reference features.	0
And on  that  one, uh the French one is - was better.	0
I mean it was  enough  better that - that it would	1
uh account for a fair  amount  of the  difference	1
So.  Uh. So if they have a  better  one, we should  use  it. I mean.   You know? it's -  you can't work on  everything.  Uh.	1
Yeah, so we should find out if it's really  better.  I mean if it -	0
the - compared to the small or the big network.	0
And perhaps we can easily improve if - if we put like mean normalization before the - before [MASK] Because -	0
as - as you've  mentioned. Mmm.	0
H- Hynek will be back in town uh the week after next, back - back in the country. So.   And  start - start organizing uh  more visits and connections and so forth, and -  uh	1
Also is Stephane was thinking that  maybe it was useful to f- to think about uh  voiced-unvoiced - to work uh here in voiced-unvoiced detection.	1
And we are looking   in the uh signal.	0
Yeah, my  feeling  is that	1
when we look at all the proposals, ev- everybody is still using some kind of [MASK] and	1
No use of pitch uh basically. Yeah.	1
Yeah, well, not  pitch,  but to look at the um fine -	1
at the - at the high re- high resolution spectrum.	1
We don't necessarily want to find the - the pitch of the - of the  sound  but	0
Cuz I have a feeling that	1
when we look - when we look at the - just at the  envelope  there is no way you can tell if it's voiced and unvoiced, if there is some -	1
It's - it's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency and.	0
So there would be more,	0
there is the first  formant,  which is the larger	0
and then voiced sound are more high frequencies	0
cuz it's frication and -	0
When you have noise there is no um -  if - if you have a low frequency noise it could be taken for - for voiced speech and.	0
Yeah, you can make these mistakes, but - but -	0
So I think that it - it would be good - Yeah, yeah, well, go - go on.	0
Uh, I was just gonna say isn't there -	0
aren't - aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity, or speech-nonspeech rather,  um by looking at  um, you know, uh  I guess  harmonics  or looking across  time  -	0
Well, I  think  he was talking about the voiced-unvoiced, though, right? So, not the speech-nonspeech.	0
Well even with  e- uh w- ah	0
you know, uh even with the voiced-non-	0
I thought that you or  somebody was talking about -	0
Well. Uh yeah. B- We should let him  finish  what he w- he was gonna  say,  and -	0
Um yeah, so yeah, I think if we try to	1
well, there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second, it could be interesting to have that's - something that's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum.	1
Yeah, so I don't know. We were thinking about like using ideas from - from Larry Saul,	0
have a good voice detector,	0
have a good, well, voiced-speech detector,	1
that's working on - on [MASK] and	1
uh Larry Saul could be an idea. We were are thinking about just	1
kind of uh taking the spectrum and	1
of - of the high resolution spectrum  and	1
O_K. So - So  many   tell you something about that. Uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on	1
voicing information uh to  help in reducing the noise.	1
So what he was doing is basically y- you -  you  do  estimate the pitch.	1
And um you - from that you - you estimate - or you estimate fine harmonic structure, whichev- ei- either way, it's more or less the  same.  But	1
uh the thing is that um you then	0
can get rid of things that are not - i- if there is strong harmonic structure,	1
you can throw away stuff that's - that's non- harmonic.	1
And that - that is another way of getting rid of part of the  noise	1
So um that's something  that is sort of  finer,  brings in a little more information than just [MASK]	1
Um. And he had some - I mean, he did that sort of [MASK] was taking care of convolutional stuff and he was -	1
and - and got some - some decent results doing that. So that - that's another - another way.	1
But yeah, there's - there's - Right. There's all these cues. We've	0
actually back when  Chuck  was here we did some voiced-unvoiced uh  classification using a bunch of these, and - and uh	0
works O_K. Obviously it's not perfect but um -  But the thing is that you can't -	0
given the constraints of this task, we can't,  in a very  nice  way, feed  forward to the recognizer the information - the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it's voiced or unvoiced, where w- we can't you know affect the -  the uh distributions or anything.	0
But we - what we uh -	0
Didn't the head dude send around that message? Yeah, I think  you  sent us all a copy of the message,	0
where he was saying that -	0
I- I'm not sure,  exactly,  what the  gist  of what he was saying, but	0
something having to do with the voice  activity detector and that it will -	0
that people shouldn't put their  own   in  or something. It was gonna be a -	0
That - But - O_K. So that's  voice  activity detector as opposed to  voicing  detector. So we're talking about something a little  different.	0
Oh, I'm sorry. I - I missed that.	0
Right?  I guess what you could do,  maybe  this would be w- useful, if - if you have - if you view the second stream,	0
yeah, before you - before you do [MASK] and so forth,  if you  do  view it as probabilities,	0
and if it's an independent -	0
So, if it's - if it's uh  not  so much  envelope-based by fine-structure-based, uh looking at harmonicity or something like that,	0
um if you get a probability from  that  information and then multiply it by - you know, multiply by all the voiced	0
outputs and all the unvoiced outputs, you know,	0
then  use  that  as the uh -	0
take the log of  that  or  uh pre- pre- uh - [MASK]	0
uh and do [MASK] on the - on - on  that,   then that would - that would I guess	0
be uh a reasonable use of independent information.	0
So maybe that's what you meant.	0
And then that would be -	0
Yeah, well, I was not thinking this - yeah, this could be an- yeah	0
So you mean have some kind of probability for the v- the voicing and then	0
Right. So you have a  second  neural net. It could be pretty small.	0
Yeah. If you have a tandem system and then you have some kind of - it can be pretty small - net -  we used - we d- did some of this stuff. Uh I - I did, some years ago, and the - and - and you use -  the thing is to use information  primarily  that's different	0
as  you  say, it's more fine-structure-based than - than envelope-based  uh so then it you - you - you can pretty much guarantee it's stuff that you're not looking at very  well  with the other one,  and uh then you  only  use for this one distinction.	0
And - and so now you've got a probability of the cases,  and you've got uh the probability of the  finer  uh categories on the other side. You multiply them where appropriate and uh  um	0
if they really are from independent  information sources then  they should have different kinds of errors and roughly  independent  errors, and  it's a good choice for -	0
Yeah, that's a good idea.	1
is good and we could u- we could use the fine structure to - to have a better estimate of the  noise  but	1
still there is this issue with [MASK] that it seems to increase the variance of -	1
Well it's this musical noise which is	1
annoying if you d- you do some kind of [MASK]  after.  So.	1
Well.  [MASK] don't seem to -	1
to go together very well.	1
Or if you [MASK] -	0
I mean, maybe - maybe you can do it layers or something so it doesn't - doesn't hurt too much or something.	0
But it - but uh,  anyway  I think I was sort of arguing against myself there by giving that example uh I mean cuz I was already sort of	0
suggesting that we should be careful about not spending too much time on exactly what they're doing	1
In fact if you get - if you go into uh - a uh harmonics-related thing	1
it's definitely going to be different than what they're doing  and uh	1
uh should have some interesting properties in noise.	1
Um.  I  know  that when have people have done	0
um sort of the obvious thing of taking	0
uh your feature vector and adding	0
in some variables which are	0
pitch related or uh that - it hasn't - my impression it hasn't particularly helped.	0
it i- has not, yeah.	0
Yeah.  But I think uh	0
that's - that's a question for this uh you know extending the feature vector versus having different streams.	0
Was it nois- noisy condition? the example that you -	0
And - and it may not have been noisy conditions. Yeah. I - I don't remember the example but it was -  it was on some DARPA data and some years ago and so it probably wasn't,	0
But we were thinking, we discussed with Barry about this, and  perhaps	0
thinking - we were thinking about some kind of sheet- cheating experiment where	0
we would [MASK] and see	0
uh, this voicing bit would help in -	0
in terms of uh frame classification.  Mmm.	0
why don't you just do it with  Aurora?   Just any i- in - in each - in each frame	0
Yeah, but - but -	0
B- but we cannot do the cheating, this cheating thing. Well.	0
Cuz we don't have - Well, for Italian perhaps we have, but we don't have this labeling	0
[MASK] We just have a labeling with word models but	0
we don't have frame - frame level	0
But you could - I mean you can - you can  align  so that - It's not  perfect,  but if you - if you know what was  said  and -	0
But the problem is that their models are all word level models. So there's no phone models  that you get alignments for.	0
You - So you could find out where the word boundaries are but that's about it.	0
S- But we could use uh the - [MASK] which	0
you know, is similar to the - [MASK]	0
Well, I guess - I guess we can -	0
we can say that it will  help,  but	0
If this voicing bit doesn't help, uh,	0
I think we don't have to -	0
to work more about  this  because -	0
It's just to know if it - how much i- it will help and to have an idea of	0
how much we can gain.	0
I mean in experiments that we did a long  time  ago and different ta- it was probably Resource Management or something,	0
um, I think you were getting  something like still eight or nine percent error on the voicing, as I recall.	0
what that said is that,	0
sort of, left to its own devices, like without the - a strong language model and so forth, that you would -  you would make significant number of errors  just with your uh probabilistic machinery in deciding  one oh	0
It also - Yeah, the - though I think uh there was  one  problem with that in that, you know, we used canonical mapping so  our truth may not have really been  true to the acoustics.	0
Yeah. Well back twenty  years  ago when I did this [MASK] we were getting more like	0
ninety-seven or ninety- eight  percent correct in voicing. But that was	0
on a particular announcer and - and getting a	0
very good handle on the features. And we did this complex feature selection thing where we looked at all the different possible features one could have for voicing and -	0
and - and uh - and  exhaustively  searched  all size subsets	0
and - and uh - for - for  that  particular speaker and you'd find you know the five or six features which  really  did well on them.	0
And then doing - doing all of that we could get down to two or three percent error.	0
But that, again, was speaker- dependent  with  lots of feature selection and a very complex sort of thing. So I would - I would believe	0
that uh it was quite likely that	0
looking at envelope only, that we'd be	0
all the - [MASK] what's the idea behind?	0
Cuz they - they have to -	0
Oh, they don't even  have  to detect voiced spe- speech?	0
The modern ones don't do a -  a simple switch. They work on the code book excitation. Yeah they do  analysis-by-synthesis. They try - they - they try every - every possible excitation they have in their  code  book and find the one that matches best.	0
They just work on the code book and	0
Yeah. So it would not help.	0
Can I just mention one other interesting thing?	0
One  of the ideas that we  had come up with last week for things to try to  improve the system -	0
Actually I - I s- we didn't - I guess I wrote this in after the meeting b- but  the  thought  I had was	0
looking at the  language  model that's used in [MASK]  which is basically just a big	0
loop, right? So you - it goes "digit" and then that can be - either go to silence or go to another digit, which -  That model would allow for the production of	0
infinitely long sequences of digits, right?	0
I thought "well I'm gonna just look at the -	0
what actual digit strings do occur in the training data."	0
And the interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of two-long or three-long digit strings  in any of [MASK] So it's either one, four, five, six,  uh up to eleven, and then it skips and then there's some at sixteen.	0
But what about the  testing  data?	0
Um. I don't know. I didn't look at the test data yet. So.	0
Yeah. I mean if there's some  testing  data that has - has -  has two or three -	0
Yeah. But I just thought that was a little  odd,	0
that there were no two or three long -	0
Sorry.  So I - I - just for the heck of it, I made a little grammar which um,	0
you know, had it's separate path	0
for each length digit string you could get. So there was a one-long path and there was a	0
four-long and a five-long  and I  tried  that and it got way worse. There were lots of deletions. So it was -	0
you know, I - I didn't have any weights of these paths or - I didn't have anything like that. And I played with tweaking the  word transition penalties a bunch, but I couldn't go anywhere.	0
I thought "well if I only allow -"	0
Yeah, I guess I should have looked at - to see how often there was a mistake where a  two-long  or a  three-long  path was actually put out as a hypothesis.  Um. But.	0
So to do that right you'd probably want to have -  allow for them all but then have weightings and things. So. I just thought that was a interesting  thing about the data.	0
O_K. So we're gonna read some more digit strings I guess?	0
You want to go ahead, Morgan?	0
