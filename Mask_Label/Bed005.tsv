Yeah, I think I got my mike on.	0
O_K. Ami, do yours then we'll  open it  and I think it'll be enough.	0
Mmm - Doesn't, uh - It should be the other way. Yeah, now it's on.	0
O_K. So, we all switched on?	0
We are  all  switched on, yeah.	0
Alright. Anyway. So, uh, before we get started with the, uh,  technical  part, I just want to review what I  think  is happening with the -	0
We are all switched on.	0
our  data collection.  So -	0
that shouldn't come up in this meeting. Th- this - this is s-  should   be im- it isn't - There's another thing going on of gathering data,	0
and that's pretty much independent of this.	0
But, uh, I just want to make sure we're all together on this.	1
What we think is gonna happen is that,	1
uh, in  parallel  starting about now  we're gonna get Fey	1
where you're working with me and Robert, draft a note that we're gonna send out to various CogSci c- and other classes saying, "here's an opportunity to be a subject.	1
And then there'll be a certain number of um, hours during the week which she will be available and we'll bring in	0
people. Uh, roughly how many, Robert?	0
We d- Do we know?	0
Um, fifty was  our  - sort of our first -	0
O_K. So, we're looking for a total of fifty people,  not necessarily by  any  means all students but we'll s- we'll start with - with that.	1
In  parallel  with that, we're gonna need to actually do the  script.	1
And, so, I guess there's a plan to have a meeting Friday afternoon	0
Uh, with - uh, Jane, and maybe Liz and  whoever,  on actually getting the script worked out.	1
But what I'd  like  to do, if it's O_ K,	1
to, as I say, start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week.	1
The week after that's Spring Break, and maybe we'll look for them - some subjects next door or  i-	0
Yeah. Also,  Fey  will not be here during spring break. So.	0
Oh, O_K, then we won't do it. O_K. So that's easy.	0
So, is - Is  that	0
Yeah. Also, um, F-  both Fey and I will, um,	0
do something of which I may, eh -	0
kindly ask you to - to do the same thing, which is we gonna check out [MASK] Meaning,	1
um, kid children's gymnastic classes, pre-school parents and so forth.	0
They also sometimes have flexible schedules.	0
So, if you happen to be sort of in a non-student social setting, and you know people who may be interested in being subjects -	0
We also considered using the Berkeley High School and their teachers, maybe,	0
and get  them  interested in	0
So that's as far as our brainstorming was concerned.	0
Oh, yeah. The  high  school's a  great  idea.	0
But I - I will just make a first draft of the, uh,  note,  the "write-up" note, send it to you and Fey and then -	0
And why don't you also copy Jane on it?	0
Are we - Have we concurred that, uh, these - these forms are sufficient for us, and necessary?	0
Uh, th- I think they're  necessary.	0
This - The  permission  form.	1
Uh, there  has  to  be  one, and I think we're just gonna use it as it is, and	1
Well, yeah. There's one tricky part	0
um, they have the right	0
I- The last paragraph  "if you agree to participate you have the opportunity to have anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set."	0
O_K?  Now  that,  we- had to be included for this	0
other  one which might have, uh, meetings, you know,  about  something. In this case, it doesn't  really  make sense.	0
Um, so what I'd  like  to do	1
is  also  have  our  subjects sign a waiver	1
saying "I don't want to see the final transcript".	1
And if they  don't  - If they say "no, I'm not willing to  sign  that", then we'll  show  them the final transcript. But, um.	0
yeah , so we  might  actually, um	0
S- i-  Jane  may say that, "you know, you can't  do  this", uh,	0
"on the same form, we need a  separate  form." But anyway. I'd - I'd - I'd like to,	0
e- e- um, add an- a little thi- eh - a thing for them to initial, saying "nah, do- I don't want to see the final transcript." But other than that, that's one's been approved,	0
this really  is  the same project,	0
uh, rec- you know. And so forth. So I think we just go with it.	0
So much for the data,	0
except that with Munich everything is fine now.	1
They're gonna  transcribe. They're also gonna translate the, uh, German data from the	1
T_V and cinema stuff for Andreas. So.	1
They're -  they  all seem to be happy now,	0
So.   w- c-  sh- should we move on to the technical sides?	0
Well I guess the good -  good  news of  last  week was the  parser.	0
Bhaskara and I started working on the -	0
the parser. Then Bhaskara went to class and once he came back, um,	0
It, uh - I didn't measure it, but it was about an hour and ten minutes.	0
And, um - and now it's - We have a complete English parser that does everything the German parser does.	1
Which is  not a  lot.  But -	0
The - uh,  that's  not a  lot.	0
What did you end up having to do? I mean, wha- Was there anything	0
Well, if you, eh -	0
interesting about it at all? or are we gonna see that?	0
Yeah, we can  show  us, right?	0
We d- The first we did is we - we tried to - to do - change the - the   "laufen"   into "run",  or "running",  or "runs".	0
And we noticed that whatever we tried to do, it no effect.	0
And, uh, the  reason  was that the parser i- c-	1
parses  the p- the same output,	0
um, even if you leave out, um,	0
all - all of  this.  So it's basically feature film and T_V.	0
Today  O_K. And the - t- and the time, right?	0
If - if you'd add - add Today and Evening, it'll add Time or not. So it - i- it  does  look at that. But all the rest is p- simply frosting on the cake,	0
and it's optional for that parser.	0
So, you can sho- You - you - Are - are you gonna show us the little templates?	0
Yeah. We ar- we can sh- er - I can show you the templates.	0
"The former end g-"   Oh, I see. Uh-huh.	0
I - I also have it  running  here, so if I	0
um,  you can see that	0
it parsed the wonderful English sentence, "Which films are on the cinema today  evening?"	0
Uh do- don't worry about it. It could be	0
" this  evening, which - which films are on the cinema", or "running in the cinema, which -"	0
uh, "today evening", uh i-	0
"Is anything happening in the cinema this evening?"	0
O_K.  Key  words, e- basically.	0
Ge- elaborate, or, more or less,  uh -	0
Actually, it's a  little  tricky,	0
Oh.  So it - it doe- I- it - These -	0
u- these optional elements, it's - it's actually a  set,  not a  sequence?	0
Yeah. We were - I was afraid that, um -	0
So it really  is  key word matching, basically.	1
Um, I mean, these sentences are just silly. I mean, uh, d- these were not the ones we - we actually  did  it.	0
Um. What's an idiomatic of phrasing this? Which films are	0
@@   Are pl-  playing  at the cinema?	0
I changed that file, actually, where it's on my account.	0
Actually, you would say, "which films are  on  tonight?"	0
You want to get it? Or - is - di- was it easy to get it?	0
Um. I have no net here.	0
O_K. So. Wonderful parse, same thing.	0
Except that we d- w- we don't have this, uh, time information here now, which is,	0
Oh. This - are the reserve.	0
These are the - sort of the ten different sentence types	1
the parser was able to do. And it still  is,  now in English.	1
you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate, right?	0
Yeah, I mean I changed those sentences to make it, uh,	0
And, of course, you can have i-	1
many  variations in those sentences, they will still parse fine.	1
So, in a sense it's pretty broad.	0
So, if you want to  look  at the templates,	0
they're conveniently located in a file, "template".	0
and  this  is what I had to do. I had to change,  @@	0
"Spielfilm"   to "film", uh,   "Film"   to "movie", cinem-   "Kino"   to "cinema" -	0
to- "today" - heu-   "heute"   to "today", evening -   "Abend"   to "evening"	0
One thing I was wondering, was,	1
those functions there, are those things that modify [MASK] basically?	1
And that's - that's the next step, but we'll get to that in a second.	0
And so  this  means, um,	0
"this" and "see" are not optional.	0
"Want I like" is all  maybe  in there, but may also  not  be in there.	0
So - so, the  point  is, if it says " this " and " see ", it also will work in " see " and " this "?	0
with those two key words?	0
"This is the one I want to see"	0
whatever.  Nothing   was specialfi- specified.	0
except  that it has some references to [MASK] here.	0
Where it gets  that  from -  It's correct, but I don't know where it gets it from.	0
Oh, " see ". Yeah.	0
I mean it's sort of -	0
is exactly the same thing.	0
O_K, so it  is  [MASK] Alright.	0
One thing I was wondering was,	1
why do we even  have  them? Because - if you didn't have them -	0
Uh, I'll  tell  you why. Because it gives a - you a  score.	0
And the value of the score is, v-  I  assume,	1
I  guess, the more of these optional things that are actually in there, the higher [MASK]	1
So  that's  the main purpose. Alright.	0
So we - we shouldn't belittle it  too  much. It's  doing  something,	0
No, no. Fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah, flexible it  is.	0
Um, let's hope that the generation will not be more difficult, even though the generator is a  little  bit more complex.	1
that means we may need two hours and twenty minutes rather than an hour ten minutes,	0
And the next thing I would  like  to be able to do, and it seems like this would not be too difficult  either,  is	1
to say, "O_K let's now pretend we  actually   wanted to not only change the -	1
[MASK] but we also wanted to change - add a new sentence type and and make up some -	1
That'd be  great.  It would be a good exercise to just see	0
whether one can get that to  run.	0
So, that's - Fine, yeah.	0
that's - shouldn't be too tough.	0
Yeah, so where are those - those functions "Action", "Goodbye", and so on, right? Are they actually, um,	1
Are they going to be called? Um, are they present in the code for the parser?	1
Yeah. I think what it does, it i- i- it does something sort of fancy. It loads	0
It has these style sheets and also the, um,	0
So what it probably does, is it takes the, uh,	0
Is this where it is? This is already the X_M_L stuff?	0
This is where it takes its own, um, syntax,	0
Where is the uh -	0
What are you looking for?	0
Um, where it actually produces the - the X_M_L out of the, uh, parsed  stuff.	0
No, this is not it.	0
Uh. I can't find it now.	0
You mean, where the - where the act- how the action "Goodbye"	0
Yeah, where are those constructors defined?	0
This is sort of what happens.	0
This is what you would need to - to change - to get the, uh, X_M_L changed.	0
So when it encounts- encounters "Day",	0
activate those h- classes in the - in the X_M_L stuff	0
I  saw  those actions - uh, [MASK] somewhere.	0
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.	0
Well, we'll find that out.	1
So whatever - n- this does - I mean this is, basically, looks l- to me like a function call, right?	0
So, whenever it - it encounters "Goodbye",	0
which we can make it do in a second, here	0
That function automatically generates an initialized	0
I think each of those functions act on the current X_M_L structure, and	1
change it in some way, for example, by adding a -	1
a l- a  field  to it, or something.	1
Yeah. They also seem to affect  state,  cause some of them -	1
uh, that - that s- seemed to step - state variables somewhere, like the n- s- [MASK]	1
O_K. So that's going to be a call on the discourse and  confirm that it's -	0
Oh, you mean that's not going to actually  modify  the tree, but it's going to  change  the event.  Oh.   Oh.	0
I think that's right. I think it's actually - That  looks  like it's state modification.	0
There is a feature called [MASK]	0
And so whenever I just say, "Write",	0
it will - it will put this in here.	0
Oh, so it always just - Is it - So it -	0
Well, go  back,  then, cuz it may be that  all  those th- things,	0
while they  look  like function calls, are just	0
a way of adding exactly that to the X_M_L.	0
I'm not - I'm not  sure.	0
e- I'm not sure - e- that -	0
Um - well, we - we'll see, when we say,	0
causes it to c- to create basically [MASK]  Which is a means of telling the system to shut down.	0
Now, if we know that "Write"	0
So if I now say "Write,	0
It sho- it creates  this,	0
But there  is  some kind of function call, because how does it know to put Goodbye in Content, but, uh, Confirm in Features?	0
Oh. It d- it - n- That's because -	0
So, it's not just that it's adding that field. It's	0
It's - it's - the - It's under what sub-type you're doing it. Yeah.	0
Well, they're  defined  somewhere, presumably.	1
Well, sometimes it m- Sometimes, i-	0
Yeah, each is - S- so that's funny. You bury the s- the state in the function	0
Well, it just automatically initializes things that are common, right? So it's just a shorthand.	0
For example - Oh, this is German. Sorry.	0
So, now,  this,  it cannot do anymore. Nothing comes out of here.	0
A "not a number" is a value. Awesome.	0
doesn't speak German anymore, but it does speak English.  And there is, here,	0
So, this tells us that whatever is - has the I_D " zero " is referenced here -	0
by  @@   [MASK]  and this is exa- "I want -"	0
"I want two seats here."	0
"need two seats here."  Nuh .	0
"And where is it playing?" There should also be a reference to something, maybe.	0
Our d- This is re- um	0
Here, we change - and so, we - Here we add something to [MASK] that the user wants to change something that was sort of done before	0
and that, whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema.	0
So then, whatever takes [MASK] is what actually changes the state, not the -	0
I  see. And it - and it runs around looking for [MASK]	0
and doing whatever it does with them.	0
And other people  ignore  those tags.	0
So, yeah. I definitely think it's -	1
the exercise of trying to	1
Sort of  get  a complete understanding of the whole thing.	1
Yeah,  a kid  understanding what's going on.  Then the  next  thing we talked about is actually,	0
um, figuring out how to add our own	0
tags,  and stuff like that.	0
I got the, uh, [MASK] today.	1
Uh, so I got some more.	0
This is sort of the uh,  um,	0
Hmm. Interesting. It's just going  up,  it's not going	0
So, this is - um, what I got today is  the - [MASK] for	0
uh, and with some examples - So, this is the X_M_L and this is sort of what it will look like later on,	0
even though it - you can't see it on - on this resolution.	0
And this is what it - sort of is the - [MASK]	0
and here is the  more  interesting stuff for us, is the routes,	0
and, again, as we thought it's really simple. This is sort of the, uh,	0
simple [MASK] and so forth,	0
points of interest along the way -	0
I asked them whether or not we could, um -	0
First of all, I was little bit -	0
It seemed to me that this m- way of doing it is sort of a stack- a step backwards from the way we've done it before. t-	0
It seems to me that some notions were missing.	0
So these are - these are -	0
So these are - these are your friends back at [MASK]	1
Yep. Who are doing this.	0
So this is not a  complicated  negotiation.	0
There's - there's not  seven  committees, or anything, right?	0
No, this is very straightforward.	0
Great.  So this is just trying to -	0
It's a  design  thing, not a  political  thing.	0
Once we've - eh - We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done.	0
e- So that you understand, it is  really  simple. Uh - You - you have a  route,  and you cut it up in different pieces.	1
every  element  of that e- r- r- f- of that -	1
Every  segment  we call [MASK]	1
And so, from A_ to B_ we cut up in three different steps,	1
and every step has [MASK] where you  start,	1
What w- I was sort of missing here, and uh, maybe it was just me being too stupid, is,  I didn't sort of get the - the notion of the global goal	0
of the whole route. Really, s- was not straightforward visibly for me.	0
And some  other  stuff. And I	1
suggested that they should n- be - k- uh, kind enough to do s-  two  things for us, is one, um,	1
Also allocating, uh, some tags for our [MASK]	1
um, since  you  had suggested that -	0
that, um, we figure out if we ever, for a  demo  reason, wanted to shortcut directly to [MASK]	0
of how we can do it.	0
Now, what's the state of the art of getting to  entrances,  um, what's the syntax for that, how get- getting to   vista  points and calculating those on the spot.	0
And [MASK] anyhow, is the default.	1
That's all they do it these days. Wherever you'll find a route planner it n- does nothing but get to the closest point where the street network is	1
at minimal distance to the geometric center.	1
So, well, let - Now, this is  important.  Let, uh - I want a- a- Again, [MASK]	0
You're in the midst of this, so you know better. But it seems to me it's  probably	0
li- uh -  minimize  the number of	0
uh,  change  requests we make of them.	0
So it seemed to me, what we ought to do is get  our  story together.	1
O_K? And think about it some,  internally,  before	1
asking them to make  changes.	1
Oh. Does this - does this make sense to you guys? It - I mean you're - you're doing the - the interaction but it seemed to me that	0
what we  ought  to do is come up with a -	0
uh, something where you, um -	0
And I - I don't know who's mok- working most closely on it.  Probably  Johno.	0
Uh, take what they have,	0
send it to everybody saying "this is what they have, this is what we think we should add",	0
O_K?  and then have a d- a - an iteration within  our  group saying "Hmm, well -"	0
O_K? And get  our  best idea of what we should add.	0
And  then  go back to them.	0
Is i- or, I don't know does this make sense to you? Or	0
Yeah.  Especially if we want -	0
Sort of, what I -  my  feeling was eh- we - we sort of reserved something that has a r- eh-	0
an O_K label. That's - th- that was my th- first sort of step.	0
No matter  how  we want to call it,	0
this is sort of our playground. And if we get something in there that is a structure  elaborate  and - and - and - and - and  complex  enough to - to - to maybe enable a whole  simulation,	0
that would be - u- the - the perfect goal.	0
That's right. So. So, Yeah. The problem isn't [MASK]	1
It's the sort of - o- one or two  year  kind of thing. O_K. What are the thl-  class  of things we think we might try to  do  in a year or two?	1
How - how would we try to  characterize  those and what do we want to request  now	1
that's leave enough space to  do  all that stuff?	1
Right. And that re- that requires some thought.	0
And - so that sounds like a  great  thing to do	0
um, as soon as we can do it.	0
So y- so you guys will  send to the rest of us	0

tourists in Heidelberg.  It seems to me we can get	1
all the complexity we want in actions and in language	1
without going outside of tourists in Heidelberg.	1
But you know, i- depending on what people are interested in,	0
one could have,  uh,  tours,  one could have	0
um, explanations of  why  something is - is, you know, why -  why  was this done, or - I mean, no - there's  no  end	0

uh, what a tourist in Heidelberg might	0
So, at least - unless somebody else wants t- to suggest  otherwise  I think	1
we don't have t- to	1
That is,  tourists  in Heidelberg.	1
And if there's something somebody comes up with that  can't  be done that way, then,  sure.  W- we'll - we'll look at that, but	0
I'd be s- I- I'd be surprised at -	0
important  issue that - that -	0
I mean if - if you want to	0
uh, push us into reference problems, that would be great.	0
O_K, so this is - his specialty is - reference,	0
and - you know, what - what  are  these things referring to? Not  only	0
[MASK] but, uh, more generally the,	0
uh,  [MASK] and, what is it that they're actually	0
dealing  with in the world?	0
And, again, this is li- in the databa- this is also  pretty  well formed because there is [MASK]	1
and the database, and stuff. So it isn't like,	1
um, you know, the Evening Star or stuff like that. I- i- it -	1
do  have concrete reference. Although th- the  To get at them from a language may not be trivial.	1
um, what w- what things the system  knows  about.	0
Right.  And you have both proper names and descriptions and y- and you can  ask  for it.	0
All  those things. Yeah. You have proper names, and descriptions.	0
And  a l- and a lot - and - and [MASK] and pronouns, and	0
Now , we hav- the - the whole - Unfortunately, the whole database is, uh,  in  German.	1
We have just commissioned someone to translate some bits of it, I_E the e-	1
the shortest k- the - the more general descriptions of all the objects and, um, persons and events. So, it's a relational database with persons, events,	1
And it's - it's quite, um,	0
there. But  did y-  I - uh - I think  there  will be great because the reference problem really is not trivial, even if you have such a g-	0
Ah- he-  you are not, uh, throwing uh, uh, carrying owls to Athens.	0
Could you give me an example of a reference problem?  so - so l- I can  make it more concrete?	0
How do I get to the Powder-Tower?	0
We sort of t- think that  our  bit in this problem is interesting, but, just to get from  Powder-Tower  to an object I- I_D in a database	0
is  also  not really trivial.	0
Or - or if you take something even  more  scary, um, "how do I get to the third building  after  the Tower? the Ple- Powder-Tower?" Uh, you need some mechanism  for	0
Or, you know, the church across from City Hall, or -	0
Or the re- the restaurant where they wear   lederhosen?   Or is that -	0
Yeah, that would be fine.	0
O- or - or tower, or  this  tower, or  that  building, or -	0
Or you can say "how -" you know, "how do I get  back? "	0
And,  again,  it's just a question of  which  of these things,	0
uh, I think  I'm  gonna try to do,	0
let's say that by the end of spring break,	1
I'll try to come up with some	1
um, [MASK] and what constructions we'd use and how all this might	1
fit together. There's this whole  framework  problem that I'm feeling really uncomfortable about.	1
And I haven't had a chance to	0
think about it seriously. But I - I want to -	0

Yeah, or, you know. "Wh- why is he - why is he pushing for promotion?" or, "who's pushing proof-" er, just pick - pick any of them and just	0
do the - eh -	0
So I don't - I don't think,	0
Uh, to convert them to question forms that  really  exist and people say all the  time,	0
And - sort of - we don't know how to handle them,  too.  Right? I mean, it's -	0
We  don't  know how to handle [MASK]	0
Yeah. Nancy, it looked like you were s-	0
Oh. it's just that - that the goals	0
are g- very different to cases - So we  had  this problem last year when we first  thought  about this domain, actually, was that	0
most  of the things we talked about are our story understanding. Uh, we're gonna have a short discourse and  the person talking is trying to,	0
I don't know, give you a statement and tell you something. And here,  it's th-	0
Help you create a mental model, blah-blah-blah.  Yeah.	0
Yea- eh - y-  Yeah,  I  guess  so. And then here, y- you are j- uh, the person is getting information and they or may not be following some larger plan,	0
you know, that we have to recognize or, you know, infer.	0
And th- th- the - [MASK] probably	0
don't follo- follow quite as many	0
Right. No, I think that's one of things that's interesting, is - is in this sort of	1
over- arching  story we - we worked it out for th- as you  say,  this - the storytelling scenario.	1
And I think it's really worth thinking  through	1
what it looks like. [MASK] et cetera.	1
Right. Cuz for a while we were thinking, "well, how can we  change  the,  um, data to sort of illicit tha-  illicit, um, actions that are  more  like what we are used to?"	0
But obviously we would rather, you know, try to figure out what's - what's, you know -	0
Well, I don't know. I mean, maybe - maybe that's what we'll do is - is s- u- e-	0
We can do anything we want with it. I mean, once we have fulfilled these requirements,	1
O_K, and the one for next	0
half  done and then the  other  half is this,	0
"generation thing" which we think isn't much different.	0
then  all  the rest of it is,	0
you know, what  we  want to do for the  research.	0
And we can - w- we can do all  sorts  of things that don't fit into their	1
Th- there's  no  reason why we're c- we're constrained to  do  that.	0
If  we can  use  all the, uh,	0
would be too - too much pain to do  ourselves.  But there's no  obligation  on any of this.	0
So, if we want to turn it into u- understan- standing  stories  about Heidelberg,	1
I mean, that would just be a t- a- um -	0
Or, as a matter of fact, we  need  -	0
and if we if we'r- eh - take a  ten  year perspective, we  need  to do that,  because	0
e- w- a- Assuming we  have  this, um, we- we- ta- in that case we  actually    do  have these wonderful stories, and historical anecdotes, and	0
knights jumping out of windows, and-and-and -	0
tons  of stuff.  So, th- the database is huge,	0
and if we want to answer a  question  on that,	0
we actually have to go one step before that, and  understand  that.	0
In order to e- do  sensible  information extraction. And so,	0
um, this has been a - a - [MASK] that was - is - is part of the unresolved, and to-do's, and something for the future, is	0
how can we sort of	0
run  our our  text,  our  content,  through a  machine   that will enable  us,  later, to	0
retrieve or answer e- questions more sensibly?	0
So, uh - So, uh, I was just going to ask, um,  so,	0
what is the - the basic thing that - that you are, um, obligated to do, um, uh, by the summer before w- uh y- c- we can move -	1
O_K. So - eh - Yeah. So, what  happened  is,	0
there's this, eh, uh - Robert was describing	1
the - There's two packages there's a,	1
uh, [MASK] there's a particular  piece	1
of this  big  system, which, in  German,	1
uh, takes these t- sentence templates and produces X_M_L structures.	1
And  one  of our jobs was to make the  English  equivalent of  that.	1
That,  these guys did in a - in a day.	1
The  other  thing is, at the  other  end,  roughly  at the same level,	1
produces an  output  X_M_L structure which is	1
O_K? And then there's a language  generator,  and then after that a s- a synthesizer that	1
goes from an X_M_L structure to,	1
actual specifications for a  synthesizer.	1
Eh, but again, there's  one  module in which there's  one	1
that we have to convert to English.	1
O_K. And that - But as I say, this is -	0
all   along  was viewed as a kind of -	0
a m- a minor thing,	0
necessary,  but - but not -	0
And much more  interesting  is the fact that,	0
as part of  doing  this, we - we are,	0
you know, inheriting this system that does all  sort-  of these other	0
Not  precisely  what we want, and that's -	0
that's wh- where it -	0
it gets difficult. And I - I don't pretend to understand yet what I think	0
we really ought to do.	0
So, e- enough of that,	0
the e- sort of, Johno and I will take up that	0
and, um, get a first draft of  that.	0
Now, we have um just, I think  two  more  short  things.	0
y- you guys sort of started fighting, uh, on [MASK]	0
Yeah, I thought I should, um,	0
talk a little bit about  that,  because that might be a good, uh,	0
sort of architecture to have, in general for, uh, problems with,	0
you know, multiple inputs to a node.	0
And what's the  other  one? so that - just we know what the d- agenda is?	0
Um, [MASK] I think maybe -	0
Oh, yeah. I've got [MASK] as well. Uh, so I - I've been in contact with Wu, so,  probably  let's	0
put that off till I - I - till I understand better,	0
uh, what he's doing. It's just a  little  embarrassing cause all this was in his thesis and I was on his thesis committee,	0
and, so,  I r- really  knew  this at one time.	0
But, I - I -	0
It's not only uh  Is - Part of what I haven't figured out yet is - is how all this goes together.	0
So I'll dig up some more	0
And - so why don't we just do the, uh -	0
O_K. So -  should I - Is there a white board here that I can use?	0
Or shall I just use this?	0
It's  probably  just as easy. I-	0
You can put the microphone in your pocket.	0
I was envying you and your pocket cause I don't have one.	0
It was a quick one,  huh ?	0
That's why they invented "pocket T_'s".	0
Yeah. So, um -  Recall that, uh,	1
this kind of structure in [MASK]	1
Namely, that, um -   You have these nodes that have several bands, right? So -	0
Does  I mean, they sort of -	0
the typical example is that, um, these are all a bunch of cues for something, and this is a certain effect that we'd like to conclude.	1
Like, let's just look at the case when, um, this is actually the - the final action, right? So this is like, uh,	0
touch, or - Sorry. Uh	0
Yeah, E_-   [MASK] , right?	1
W- what was this? It - i- i- i- ehhh,  i- ehhh.	0
Wri- write it out for- for -	0
So, I mean, we'd like to - take all these various cues, right? So this one might be, say, uh -	0
New terminology?  I haven't heard that before.	0
Well, let me pick a random one and say, uh -	0
I don't know, it could be, like -	0
This isn't the way it really is, but let me say - that, suppose someone mentioned, uh,	0
Ah, it takes too long. Try - let me just say "Landmark".	0
If the thing is a landmark,	0
you know,  um - then there's another thing that says if -	0
if it's  closed  or not, at the moment.	0
Alright, so you have nodes.  Right? And the, uh, problem that we were having was that, you know, given N_nodes, there's "two to the N"	0
Given N_nodes, and furthermore, the fact that there's three things here, we need to specify "three times", uh, "two to the N" probabilities.	1
Right? That's assuming these are all binary, which f- they may not be. For example, they could be "time of day", in which case we could, uh, say, you know, "Morning,	0
afternoon, evening, night". So, this could be more	0
So, it's a  lot,  anyway.	0
And, that's a lot of probabilities to put here, which is kind of a pain. So	1
[MASK] are a way to, uh,	1
sort of deal with this.	1
Where should I put this?	0
So, the idea is that, um,	0
Let's call these, uh, [MASK] I guess.	0
The idea is to have these intermediate nodes.	0
Well, actually, the idea, first of all, is that each of these things has [MASK] which means that this is	0
the state in which we don't  really   know anything about it. So - right?	0
So, for example, if we don't really know  if the thing is a landmark or not,	1
Or, i- if that just doesn't seem relevant, then that would be th- sort of [MASK] It's a really, you know,	1
if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee,	0
you know, if they didn't talk about it, that would be [MASK]	0
S- so, this is a fanciful way of saying "default"?	0
Yeah, yeah. That's just what they - the word they used in that paper.	0
So, the idea is that, um,  you have these intermediate nodes, right? [MASK]	0
So, this is [MASK] you're working with? Good.	1
The idea is that, [MASK]	1
represents  what  this would be -	1
if  all  the other ones were in the distinguish state. Right?	1
So, for example, suppose that the person - I mean, suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark.	0
But none of the other -  sort of cues really apply.	0
Then,  this would be -	0
W- The  this would just represent the probability distribution of this,	0
assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply?	0
So, you know, if it is a landmark, and no- none of the other things really ap- applicable, then - this would represent the  probability distribution.   So maybe in this case -	1
Maybe we just t- k- Maybe we decide that,  if  the thing's a landmark and we don't know anything else, then we're gonna conclude that, um -	0
They want to view it with  probability,   you know, point four.  They want to enter it with  probability,   uh -	0
with  probability   point five  and they want to approach it probability point one, say -	0
Right? So we come up with these l- little tables for each of those	1
And the final thing is that, um -	1
this is a deterministic function of these,	1
so we don't  need   to specify any probabilities.	0
We just have to, um, say what function this is, right?	0
So we can let this be, um -	0
and our example [MASK] would be, um,	0
Well. O_K, so th- so the  important  point -	0
W-  not  what [MASK] is.	0
The important point is -	1
There is a - a - a general kind of idea of shortcutting [MASK] Th- c- the full conditional probability table - with  some  function.	1
O_K? Which y- w- you choose appropriately for each case. So, depending on  what your situation is,  there are  different functions which are most appropriate.	0
So I gave - eh - Bhaskara a copy of this, eh - [MASK] D- and  you  got one, Robert. I don't know who else has seen it.	0
There's - I mean - yeah. it's Heckerman and Breese.	0
So, I- u- w- Um, yo- uh - you - Have  you  read it yet?	0
Uh, you can - Yeah, you should take a look at it, I guess.	0
O_K, so you should take a look. Nancy, I'm sure you read it at some point in life.	0
I - yeah. I - I think so, yeah.	0
And - so, you other guys can decide how interested -  Anyway.  So the paper isn't th- isn't real hard.  And -	0
One of the questions  just come at  Bhaskara is,	0
"How much of this does [MASK] support?"	0
Yeah, it's a good question. Um	1
The - so what we want, is basically JavaBayes to support deterministic, uh, functions.	1
And, um -  In a sense it sup- we can make it supported by, um,  manually, uh, entering, you know, probabilities that are one and zeros, right?	0
Right. So the little handout that - The little thing that  I  sent - I sent a message saying,	0
uh, here is a way to take -	0
One thing you could do, which is kind of s- in a way, stupid, is take this deterministic function,	0
and use it to build [MASK]	0
So, if [MASK] won't do it  for  you,	1
that you can convert all that into what [MASK] would be.	0
Um - and, what  I  sent out about a week ago, was an idea of how to  do  that,	0
um, [MASK] So one of - one function that you  could  use as you	0
uh, if each of th- if each of the ones has its own	0
little table like that,  then you could take the,	0
uh, strength of each of those, times its little table, and you'd add up [MASK]	0
I don't think you can do this, because -	0
[MASK] is a function from	0
Right? So there's no numbers. There's just -	0
quadruplets of - well, [MASK]	0
No, no - But I'm saying is - There -	0
There is a w- I mean, if y- if - if you decide what's - what is appropriate, is [MASK] you can write a function	0
that does it. It's a  pui- it's  actually one of the examples he's got in there.	0
But,  anyway,  s- skipping - skipping the question of  exactly  which functions -	0
that you might like to be able to	0
the whole conditional probability table.	0
I mean, in some - it seems very plausible in some sense, where we  will  be likely to  not  be -  observe  some of the stuff.	0
Cuz we don't have the a- access to the information.	0
Right. That's one of the problems, is, W- Is - is, Where would th- Where would it all come from?	0
Is - Oh, right. W- would not be ab- able to observe	0
I- if it's a - a - [MASK] we will have  nothing  in the discourse history.	0
So, if - if we ever want to wonder what was mention-	0
Oh. A- are you saying that we'll not be able to observe certain nodes? That's fine. That is sort of orthogonal thing.	0
Yeah, so there's - there's  two  separate things, Robert.	1
The f- the - the - [MASK] in general are quite good	1
at saying, "if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that."	1
O_K? Th- that's what they're  real  good at.	1
So, if you don't have any information about the discourse,	1
you just use your priors of - of whatever -	1
eh- the - discourse -	1
eh, basically whatever w- it's - Probabilistically, whatever it would be. And it's - it's sort of not a  great  estimate, but -	0
it's the best one you have,	0
and, so forth. So that, they're good at. But the other problem is, how do you fill in all these numbers?	0
And I think  that's  the one he was getting at.	0
Yeah. So, specifically in this case you have to - f-	0
have this many numbers, whereas in this case you just have to have three for this, three for this, three for this. Right?  So you have to have just	0
So, this is much smaller than that.	0
So, you don't need da- data enough to cover - uh, nearly as much stuff.	0
So, really, i- What a - [MASK] seems to kind of	0
Eh - well- to- some- No, no. So, [MASK] is a funny	0
way of referring to this, because	0
[MASK] is only one instance.	0
Yeah. This isn't [MASK] anymore.	0
That one actually  isn't  [MASK] So we'll have to think of	0
of a way t- t-	0
Yeah, whatever. Yeah.  So -	0
Well, my point was more that we just - eh - With [MASK] right, eh, things come in, you have a function that combines them and -	0
Yeah, it - it - Tha- that's true. It is a- is also [MASK] although -	0
Uh, it isn't  necessarily  sum -	0
uh, s- you know,  sum  of weights or anything like that.	0
I mean i- You could have,	1
really  is  one that's essentially says, uh, take the max.	1
Right. I guess you're right. Yeah.	0
And, I thi- I think that's the  standard  way people	1
There are a couple other ones. There are ways of breaking this up into s- to - to [MASK] and stuff like that. But, um	1
I think we definitely - I think it's a great idea tha- to - to pursue that.	1
Wha- still sort of leaves one question.	0
It - I mean you - you can always uh - see easily that - that I'm not grasping  everything  correctly, but  what seemed attractive to  me  in im- uh in the last discussion we had, was	0
of getting these point four, point five, point one,	0
not  because, you know, A_ is a Landmark or not, but we - we - we label this whatever object type,	0
and if it's a garden,	0
it's point three, point four, point two. If it's a castle, it's point eight, point one, point one. If it's,  uh, a town hall, it's point two, point three, point five.	0
And we don't want to write this down -	0
necessarily  every time for something but, uh -	0
It'll be students -  Where else would it  be stored? That's the question.	0
Well, in the beginning, we'll write up [MASK] We know we have twenty object types and we'll write it down in [MASK]	0
Well, let me say something, guys, cuz there's not - There's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now.	1
The hierarchy that s- comes with [MASK]	1
is  just  what you want for this. So that -	1
Uh,  if  you know about it - let's say, a  particular  town hall -	0
that, it's one that is a monument,	0
then, that would be stored  there.	0
If you  don't,  you look up the hierarchy,	0
Eh - so, you - you - you may or - So, then you'd have this little vector of,	1
um, you know,  [MASK] Let's - O_K, so we hav	1
If you  don't,  you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one.	1
So, is the idea to put it in [MASK]	0
Uh, or, link to - or - but - but in any case - i- View it logically as being in the ontology. It's part of what you  know  about -	1
a - an  object,   is [MASK]	1
And, if yo- As I say, if you know about a specific  object,   you put it there. This is part of what Dekai was doing.	0
So, when we get to Wu,	0
The- e- We'll see w- what he says about that.	0
And, then if you -	0
If it isn't there, it's higher, and if you don't know anything except that it's a b- it's - it's a - building, then up at the highest thing, you have the pr- what amounts to a prior.	0
If you don't know anything  else  about a building,	0
uh, you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at  that  level, which might be  equal,  or  whatever  it is.	0
So, that's a very pretty relationship between	1
these local vectors and [MASK]	1
And it seems to me the  obvious  thing to do, unless	0
we find a reason to do something  different.	0
Does this make sense to  you?  Bhask- ?	0
So, we are - but we - we're not doing [MASK] so we have to get to whoever is doing the - u- ultimately,	0
Indeed. So, that's another thing we're gonna need to do, is - is, to,	0
we have to get them to -	0
We're gonna need  some  way to either get [MASK]  in [MASK] or add  fields,  or -	1
some  way to associate - Or, w- It may be that all we can do is, um, some of our own hash tables that it -	0
Th- the - th- you know, there's  always  a way to  do  that. It's a just a question of -	0
But it's, uh -  Well, it strikes me as a  What For-	0
If we  get  the mechanism,	0
that will be sort of the  wonderful  part. And then,	0
how to make it  work  is - is the  second  part, in the sense that -	0
I mean, m- the guy who was doing [MASK]	0
eh, eh, s- ap- apologized that i- it will take him another through -	0
two to three days because they're having really trouble getting the upper level	0
right now.  The reason is,	1
given the  craw bet  uh, the - the - the  projects	1
that  all  carry [MASK]  and, on  all   history,	1
they're really trying to build [MASK], and that's, uh, uh, sort of a tough cookie, a little bit tougher than they	1
figured. I could have  told  them s- so. Uh.	0
But, nevertheless, it's going to be there by n- by, uh,  next  Monday and I will show you what's - what some examples   from  that for towers, and stuff.	1
what I don't think is  ever  going to be in [MASK]  is sort of, you know, the likelihood of, eh, people  entering  r-	1
town halls, and  looking  at town halls, and  approaching  town halls,	1
especially since we are b- dealing with [MASK]	1
So, there will be  nothing  on - on  that  town hall, or on the  Berkeley  town hall, or on the	0
Heidelberg  town hall, it'll just be information on town halls.	0
Well, they - they - they - How ar- What are they gonna  do  with instances? I mean, you - y-	0
That's - that's al- different question. I mean, th- the - first, they had to make a  design  question,	0
"do we take [MASK] that  have  instances? or just one that does  not,  that just has the types?"	0
And, so, since the d- decision was on  types,  on a d- simply type-based,	1
we now have to hook it up to  instances.	1
But what i- What  is    [MASK]  gonna do about that?	0
Cuz, they have instances  all  the  time.	0
Yeah, but [MASK] is really n	0
in - in and of itself. That's more something that	0
in - in [MASK] So it's a completely	0
Uh - uh -  [MASK]  g	0
Yes, u- a w- a lot of people are aware of that.	0
I  understand,   but is anybody  doing  anything about it?	0
O_K. It's  a  political problem. We won't worry about it.	0
No, but - th- the r- eh - I th- I  still  think that	0
there is  enough  information in there.	0
For example, whether - O_K. So, th- it will know about the twenty object types there are in the world.	0
Let's assume there are only  twenty  object types in this world.	0
And it will know if  any  of those have  [MASK]	0
So, in a sense, "I" used as [MASK] for some s- in some sense or the other.	0
Right? In a sense. You know.	0
Anyway.  So we  may  have to - This is with the whole thing,  we may have to build another data stru-	0
Conceptually,  we know what should be done.	0
When we  see  what people have  done,  it may turn out that the  easiest  thing to do	0
is to build a - a separate thing that - that	0
Like, i- i- it - it  may  be,	0
the - the instance - w- That we have to build our own	0
Yeah, it's - Right, we can just assume -	0
with their  types,  and then it goes off to [MASK] once you have its type. So we build a little  data  structure   And so what we would do in  that  case,	0
And if we- d- there  isn't  one we'd get the  type  and then have [MASK]  So we'd have our own little,	0
uh, vectors that we need. So, we'd have our own little  things so that whenever we needed one, we'd just use the ontology to get the type,	0
and then would hash or whatever we do to say, "ah! If it's that type of thing,	1
So, I- I think we can handle that. And then - But, [MASK]	1
and whether we can put those in [MASK] and all that sort of stuff,	1
is, uh - is the  bigger  deal.	1
I think  that's  where we have to get technically clever.	0
We could just steal the  classes  in  [MASK]  and then	0
interface  to them with our own  code.	0
Well,  I me- ye    eh, yeah, the -	0
That requires understanding [MASK] I guess.	0
Yeah, I mean, it's, uh, e- e- e- e- e-  cute.	0
I mean, you've been around enough to -	0
Well, it depends on -	0
I mean, there's this  huge  package which - which may or may not be consistent and -  you know.	0
But,  yeah,  we could look at it.	0
Well, I was j- O_K. Yeah.	0
It's an  inter-   sort  of a kind of a - it - The thing is, it's kind of an interpreter and i- i- it expects its data structures to	0
be in a given form, and if you say, "hey, we're gonna	0
make a  different  kind of  data  structure to stick in there -"	0
Well, no, but that just means there's a  protocol,	0
right? That you could -	0
It may or may not. I don't know. That's the question is "to what extent does it allow us to put in these  [MASK]	1
Well, no, but - I mean - What I  uh the  -	0
So you could have four different [MASK] that you're running, and then run your own - write your own function that would take the output of those four,	0
and make your own [MASK] is what I was saying.	0
Yeah, that's  fine  if it's - if it comes only at the  end.  But suppose you want it  embedded?	0
Well, then you'd have to break all of [MASK] int	0
Oh,  that  - Yeah, that's a  truly  horrible way to do d- it. One would  hope  -	0
Yeah, but I'm just -	0
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  you bet .	0
But, at  that  point you may say, "hey, [MASK] isn't the only package in town. Let's see if there's	0
another  package that's, eh, more  civilized  about this."	0
is worth talking to on this,	0
said that  he  actually  did	0
But he doesn't remember - at least when I talked to him, he didn't remember	0
whether it was an e- an  easy  thing, a  natural  thing, or whether he had to do some violence to it to make it work.	0
