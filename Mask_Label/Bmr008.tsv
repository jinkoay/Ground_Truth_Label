Or, I like it, also, like  this.	0
So you see  the  -	0
I just  tried  it. I think my  head is too big.	0
My head's too big, also.  It's too ba-	1
And there  is  a problem that you can hear it come and go,	1
cuz when you turn your head, then	1
you drift away from the microphone.	1
course that's true of a lapel as well.	0
Let's discuss agenda items.  What did we have?	0
I should have brought more -	0
uh  You - you were	0
I have a  couple things about speaker form -	0
is one thing  uh, there's	1
status on  on the uh	1
discussion   which will take us about thirty seconds	1
and then uh Jose  as usual	0
uh, the one among us who's actually doing a bunch of things on this	0
He has  this and I think we can have some -	0
I was just  glancing through it, so I think we	0
have something to discuss  about.	0
We just sent in that uh	0
[MASK] but I don't think there's much to say about that except	0
we've sent it in and	0
Anything else  going on? No. O_K.	0
Why don't we do it in that order?  Go ahead.	0
I uh  probably should have printed out more of these.	1
So one of the things that I've been doing with the digits forms is I've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them and it's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time.	1
So, what I  thought  was, it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once.	1
And then, on the digits form you just have to put your name down	1
and you can look it up from the speaker form.	1
so, I had a first pass of it,	1
spoke with Jane a bit about how to specify	1
what language and education and that sort of stuff and so I have a first pass at it.	1
And I was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it.	1
And I  only did one copy which was really stupid of me.	1
So I'll just sort of  say  what it's on and then I can hand it around.	1
So the top of it is	1
Email or Other Contact Information.	1
And I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name,	1
so that you can distinguish them,	1
and then also just to have a  separate  contact from the consent form.	1
And then, uh, we talked a little bit about whether to do -	1
how we get at the background.	1
And we could  do  profession, but	1
that we figured what was more important	1
was  actually the education level.	1
At least that would get at  some  idea of their background. So I have a -	1
and it's also relevant to status.	0
I c- I can insert that.	0
And s- and relevant to status.	1
So that  what I have is	0
Which might in- af- affect the discourse aspects.	0
Oh - oh, stats kind of status, O_K.	0
So - uh, I have uh,	0
five things that you can  circle,	0
Post-doc, Professor, and then Other, with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there's some Other.	1
So I think the  problem  with that is that there's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our  visitors,	1
who are  not used to the	1
help to translate what that means.	0
How fine a resolution do you  need  on that	0
Oh  I think undergrad  is useful.	0
Can you just write something like "position"?	0
and people can fill in their own  you know,	0
"Post-doc" or  "visitor" or whatever.	0
Well, the problem with that is	1
um, I think the same as the problem of  profession.	1
That it - it will be - there will be a tendency all - for everyone to put down "speech researcher" or -	1
or something at that granularity.	1
I  don't  think there's a problem  asking  the education level, I th-	1
At least  I  don't feel like there is.	1
I think the only  question  is whether the - what  categories  should there be.	1
I think that - so	1
Uh - did - are - were you suggesting that it should be  more  fine grained than this?	1
Less?  What would you suggest as a - as a change?	0
well, do you think there's -	0
I mean, were you thinking, uh, that it	1
would be useful for some research later	1
to know say, you said undergrad for instance, so, undergrad versus grad, do you think that's important?	1
I do, and the reason is because I think that	1
um, well having been a grad  student as, yeah,	1
I think there's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad	1
in terms of like the  status.	1
I mean , I mean you notice it in various ways, like	0
simply  trying to meet with a professor during office hours.	0
You know, in - in my department it was always the case grad students had a  huge	0
amount of different priority, and were treated as equals, g- and -	0
and help- helpers, you know, in - in	0
roles and things that they -	0
that they - In terms of like the s- the social dynamics of interactions,	0
I would expect them to be	0
maybe  less assertive of their own views and things like that.	0
I don't  think that we're going to  have  a lot of undergrads,	0
unless we  branch out to different types of meetings, but -	0
You could say, if you're giving a talk, how likely are you to be challenged?	0
Well, this is the dimension.	0
Well, one of the - one of the criteria	0
I had for designing this form, is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet.	0
And so we'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also.	0
Is I did  not  want to have to, you know come down and quiz each person and have a	1
being the one who's filling out the answers. I want it to be  self-evaluating.  You	1
can give it to them and they can understand what you're asking.	1
And it's non-threatening, I mean, this - this compared to, you know,	0
wh- exactly what level of professorship, and -  and -	0
Well,  sounds  like you really need to  know  something kind of like that. You need to know sort of	0
Bas- in- in this meeting,	0
sort of what is your social status?	0
Well,  I   agree  with him, though. I - Yeah.	1
get to that in a moment.	0
But I - I agree that this is	1
the rea- the motivation was	1
things that could affect social dynamics in ways that are relevant to the research	1
without being threatening to the person.	1
But - but - but it's gonna  depend  on who's -	0
And this  particular  form -	0
I  know.  So, this  particular  form	0
is dependent only on the speaker, not on the  meeting.	0
You could imagine then having  another  form	0
that you might want to do  during  a meeting	0
to get out the relationships -	0
But  then  that's interfering with the  meeting.	1
So, what I  like  about  this  information is you give it to them once,	1
and they fill it out  once,	1
and - and then you  have  that  information.	1
and we - also discussed the idea of having	1
the separate[MASK]  would handle	1
maybe, s- specific - meeting-specific things that might be relevant.	1
uh, the data, so that, you know, his [MASK] thing?	0
[MASK]	0
[MASK] p- part	0
that it's - can s- be used for relational things, yeah.	0
I guess it seems to me like you know I - trying to	0
deduce information about the person's status	0
from the meeting independent form  will be  useless  because -	0
Not  at  all.  I mean, the fact that	0
one person's an undergrad and the other's a full professor is interesting.	0
So, the question is how much of this information	0
But, that will  depend  on what the  meeting's  about,	0
right? Let's say the undergrad was an expert in physics, and -	0
But - but you  want  to have that  information.	0
Right? So, if you don't have that information,	0
how are you gonna do  anything?	0
I guess I'm wondering  how  can you make a  conclusion	0
if you  don't  know about the meeting?	0
Well, you know, we're - we're talking at - at a general level of description. You can  always  get more specific.	0
And, it may be -	0
I mean, so what would you suggest?	0
I  don't  know.  I'm just -	0
That's why I was  wondering about if you can put something about the d-	0
Can you repeat the categories you had? Maybe they're fine.	0
Undergrad, Grad, Post-doc, Professor, Other	0
So that, yeah, I think that's fine	0
thing is there are a lot of [MASK]v- like I don't know what I would be here, just	0
I'm not a professor  I'm not a -	0
oh, that's right, you know I was saying "Professor".	0
So - so anything that, like [MASK] y- I mean a	0
Yeah, when I said "Professor", I guess what I was thinking in my mind was more	0
if we can put something -	0
Yeah, that - then -	0
then  I think what you have is  great.	0
for - for that purpose  and  -	0
Would we change "Post-doc" to	0
Because I think P_H_D and Professor are d- are	0
Like, if you have a P_H_D	0
Someone who has a P_H_D.	0
and you're  hanging around here, and you're not a professor	0
and you're not a post-doc, then that's like what we are	0
Yeah so for - for me there's - there's a -	0
There's a bunch of people like that.	0
Um, this got very tricky in fact when we got involved with the  Spanish  program	1
uh, when we said, in our original forms, "post-doc"	0
what we were used to, from the German program and from the U_S standard,	0
when you say "post-doc" it meant somebody who had  just  gotten a P_H_D	0
who was doing one year someplace.	1
But when we did the  Spanish  call,	1
many people said "oh I want to be	1
uh - have a post-doc slot" and they were	1
So, you can say Post-P_H_D Researcher or	0
I - I - I think that -	0
what-  if there's one more category that's sort of	0
It might be hard to do a finer thing than that because whether somebody is going to be dominant in a meeting	0
I think it's going to be  so  clouded by everything else - Someone who's	1
uh, could be very very	1
uh, strongly opinionated about something and somebody who's been twenty years out	1
could be shy, you know, s-	1
You- I think you could keep Professor, but you could say Post P_H_D Researcher or something.	0
It could be st- It could be -	0
instead of  Professor  or instead of  Post-doc?	0
No, instead of Post - Post-doc or Post-P_H_D,	0
just wrap all the people that are post P_H_D	0
so you want Professor to be in a separate category, you think -	0
I think  professors  probably want it  I don't  care.	0
think - think we -	0
as I said Undergrad -	0
Undergrad, Grad, Post-P_H_D, Professor, Other?	0
Well, yeah the Post-P_H_D one is the one that can be, like	0
Post-doc or Post-P_H_D Researcher or	0
So, I'm te- I'm tending to push toward simpler even though I know that  more  detailed means	1
more  potential information for someone later who's doing research  in - in this area	1
I - uh - The - the - the thing	1
making me lean toward simpler where possible is that	1
uh  the more a thing -	1
Many of the meetings that we record	1
uh,  may  be the kind where we just record somebody  once	1
even though  we want to get a  lot  of data that has	1
uh,  many  meetings with the same people.	1
And so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms	0
that's th- the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do.	0
Well, the  whole  reason that I'm  doing  it this way is - is uh - my experience  so  far has been the exact  reverse.	0
Right.  That's what we've done so far.	0
Right. And so I'm saying I expect us to do both kinds.	0
I guess we could have another type of  form   for	0
Well, one thing, so you understand he -	0
he d- he wants you to do this only once for each person?	0
So I'm saying there are going to be -	0
What I imagine once we've collected a  lot  of data,	0
a chunk of it will be	0
uh, the same people many times	0
and another chunk of it will be people -  random  meetings that we got with	0
from different  people  and I think it's use- We've talked about this before, it's useful to have both kinds of data.	0
Well I think that if - if we're  planning  to do that,	0
then we should probably have another set of forms.	0
You know, a  single  form that's the consent form	0
and the speaker information form and not have them do digits.	0
No, I  like  the idea of putting down the -	0
the  status  information because I think you probably can get a lot of	0
interest- there can be a lot of interesting  research  on that.	0
could we  add  something to the  form  that gets filled out at  each  meeting	0
This is a topic I want to bring up   after  I get through this.	0
So, that - that - that's  another  form that I want to discuss.	0
with the digits forms. So, s- can we get -	0
I guess I was thinking	0
maybe, you know how you were taking information  off  of the digits and putting it onto that? Could we	0
put one more thing on here maybe?	0
That's what I want to talk about in a -	0
Yeah, I'm - I have that as a topic, also.	0
So, let's finish with the  speaker  form -	0
Cuz you said separate forms so I thought maybe -	0
speaker form and then we'll get over  o- get over to that one.	0
So, Education Level, Undergrad, Grad, Post-P_H_D, Professor, Other.	0
and then I put "Optional"	0
with a big "Optional" in parentheses, Age.	0
Wait, why is that optional?	0
Because I think a lot of people are  sensitive  to it and won't want to write it  down.	0
So I don't want to make them feel like they have to.	0
It - it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes.	0
Uh,  sure.  But if someone doesn't want to write it down I don't want them to say you can't record me -	0
a lot of corpora -	0
yeah, so we ca- we have these age ranges or something?	0
Well, wait - wait - wait - wait a minute, um,	0
It's not illegal or anything right, it's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal, whatever, to ask for their age, right?	0
No, not at all, every - most corpora have that, you know,	0
I suggest you ask for their age	0
and if they say I don't want to give it say O_K.	0
In - in like the London-Lund  they -	0
they - the researchers  themselves  estimate the age afterw- after the fact. So they say, you know, uh	0
you know  fifties or sixties, and they -	0
and they just - they estimate  for  the person	0
Well, I think that just having on the form -	1
again means  I  don't have to be  sitting  here and explaining the  form  every time we  do  this.	1
And it isn't - it isn't  that  boldf-	0
And having a little  instruction  sheet and say	0
"If you're in this age- range do this, and if you're in this rage do that."	0
And it's - and it  isn't  really that  prominent.  It's - you know his "Optional" is not really boldface, but -	0
How about "optional but highly desirable"?	0
So somebody can say "thirties" if they're thirty-nine.	0
opt- age is optional but those who don't give it will be given the uncomfortable microphones?	0
Well, those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you	0
Yeah,  If  not  given we will estimate.	0
so maybe you'll prefer to -	0
I - I think is not -	0
The - the mean of the estimates from the  group will be used	0
I think it's not necessary to put uh "Optional".	0
Yeah, people can leave it blank if they -	0
decide uh, in that moment.	0
I - I think people in Speech are gonna wanna	0
Because if you put "Optional,"	0
I think you - you give eh -	0
maybe that's because no one here is sensitive about their  age.	0
But, I would  rather  let them leave it blank than  lie.	0
O_K,  in some sense  you could say  that	0
So that's why I want to put -	1
That's why I want to put s- "Optional, Age",	1
"Please leave blank but -	0
so that if they  don't  want to  put  it,	1
But if you put "Optional", won't they just leave it  blank  rather than lie?	0
I think - I think - you can put "optional" it's not gonna -	0
I mean - I mean the peop- the people I've known who've lied about it I think	0
would just lie about it.	0
You don't think they'd just leave it blank if it says - has a big "Optional" right next to it?	0
You  know  people who  lie  about it?	0
Well they might leave it blank if they  didn't  care about their age being known	1
but it says "optional" they might	1
Hey, Jack Benny was thirty-nine for forty years.	0
the reason, uh, one reason for putting "Optional" might be if  it	1
uh, made the form seem gentler and k- and	1
not as intrusive kind of thing.	1
Yeah, I noticed, I was afraid you'd - I  shouldn't say that.	1
They uh - that, you know, i- if you	1
say "Optional" then it's sort of -	1
if people who - get nervous about the age question then they	1
"Oh well, but they're not trying to  ask me lots of  things."	1
I don't think it matters.	0
Yeah, I think it's O_K. People will put it, I - I -	0
I - I don't think it matters. If it makes you more comfortable, put Optional I -	0
I don't think it's -	0
I think it's better to put "Optional". I mean, that's why I  put  it there, s- but	0
it seems like  maybe you  disagree.	0
I  like  it. I think it's softening.	0
I - I - I don't think it's important but I also don't think it's	0
an important point the other way and I don't	0
want to make you do it some different way than you want to do it. So.	0
As long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional, if there are a lot of other optional things on the form.	0
Well I didn't mark anything else as  specifically  optional,	0
that's the only optional thing, O_K.	0
That's the only other one. That's the only one.	0
Um, and then the  next  are two sections	1
indented separately. So, one's for native English speakers and one for  non-native  English speakers.	1
O_K, so for the  native  English speaker it asks for a variety of English	1
with three circle boxes American, British, Indian and Other, for write-in.	1
Now what was this thing that -	0
who was telling - was it Steve? Somebody was telling us about	0
Where you lived between the ages of -	0
Jane and I discussed this, and it was - it was again the same problem	1
that  it's gonna be a self-evaluation  anyway,	1
and so I don't want	1
to have to be standing over the person and  asking  them	1
"Well, do you mean that your native an- l- an- language was	1
British when you were born, and then it changed to American when you were two, and then it changed to -"	1
you - you - you -	0
he has a sep- separate subject for Region.	0
and so it's a self-assessment of what  you  think your closest variety is of English. And then	0
following that, a characterization of -	0
of region. Now, we discussed maybe indicating a t- a time frame. So,	0
"Where did you live during your,  you know, childhood and adolescence?"	0
than somebody evalu- saying, I think I speak this or that.	0
Yes. Mm-hmm. Although you know I mean a  lot  of people there won't be, e- much	0
I - I - I'm sorry, so you're saying	0
I mean,  th- there's room on the form to put	0
al- a- a line of instruction, but I'm just not sure what it re- should really be.	0
uh I - I - I just missed something, though. Are you saying that you have both?	0
that you're saying, uh what is your -	0
So the - the  for	0
the non-na- for the native English speakers we have  Variety  of English and Region.	0
And that's partly to pick up - Yeah.	0
And then  we have  another  form later down which is	0
um, list other language influences.	0
So what does Region mean	0
Yeah, I was just gonna ask the same thing.	0
if  I  see this form I wouldn't be quite sure what you mean by	0
Do you want to have - give choices and have them circle one, or, I mean	0
Um,  I don't think we can do that because it would be different for -	0
Does that mean region of -	0
When we - when we discussed it it was - it was	0
where - where you lived during your childhood and adolescence.	0
Region of the U_S, or region of the world -	0
If you're  American  English it would be region of the U_S.	0
W- it's where you lived.	0
That - that - so that's why I didn't have  circle  forms. Because	0
it would be different depending on	0
what your language is. So -	0
Do you mean state,  or do you mean more broad than the state level?	0
You mean like you know	1
southern U_S, or northeastern or	1
It- I think it would be however you would identify	1
your own. And, as I said I don't really see a way of doing a  circle	1
fill  in, because there would be -	1
there would have to be one for American English, one for British English, one for	1
you know, one for each type.	1
If you wanted to get regions for American English you could copy what they did in [MASK]	0
They had divided things up into	0
But - but  that would mean I would have to do - generate a different form	0
for circles, if you're American English or British English or Indian English.	0
No, no. It would only be f-	0
if you said American English	0
yeah maybe  not  for the  others,  because there aren't going to be enough	0
then you'd put the regions. For the others, you would just leave it.	0
people to really group them	0
Yeah. We wouldn't have enough to really make them -	0
and you know when you talk about dialects in England, I mean, that's really -	0
Every block of  London has a different -	0
I haven't  seen  what - what they did in [MASK]	0
Are you s- Do they have a bunch of options like uh -	0
Oh, it's like six regions of the country or something. Very - just a limited number and then	0
if you're American you would just circle	0
Well, that's the concept, yeah.	0
Yeah, and Henry Higgins could say which block you were from.	0
Well that - you know that was the concept of having the  region  thing, I -	0
It would be no problem to  change  it to  options  if um - if  that  were  desirable.  Although for different	0
Yeah, I just don't know what to do about the other	0
Well, that's true.  I mean, Indian English I wouldn't know f-	0
I - I - there are  huge  differences	0
Well, that's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down.	0
in the others so it might be	0
better to just do it for the	0
yeah you could leave region for -	0
for the others but have  circled choice for the American  English.	0
One - one good reason to use the  [MASK]  ones is if anybody asks you	1
you know, about the data later on you can say "well I chose these	1
That  is  kind of nice.	0
the - the sort of the Steve suggestion,	0
uh, as - as an add-on to it, right? Rather than saying Region,	0
"Where did you live between the ages of	0
That  was the  concept  of region.	0
And that would apply to everybody then?	0
Yeah. And then you could  map  those to the [MASK] regions  later,  if people wanted to.	0
It's just the  wording  of it.	0
And then they - they could s-	0
Right - yeah, they could say it different ways.  They could say Cincinnati or they could say Midwest or -	0
that  is  true for them but it means that you're gonna get a bunch of different  level   -	0
levels of resolution in your survey, it - it'll be more of a pain later, so.	0
Somebody's gonna have to do some data -	0
Well, there could be a  circle  one.	0
Right? So, you could say  "What region did you grow up in from these years?" and have a  set  of circ- of six or seven circles -	0
Yeah, that -  that's  good but if you - have it totally free-form	0
First of all some people take - you-	0
Well, and some people would give you more specific	1
information than others and that's a  waste  because you can only use	1
t[MASK] and	1
but the good thing about it is it - is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right	0
I don't know later on, if - if somebody just says Midwest, now all these other people who said	0
that'll have to become your category.	0
It's harder later on, i- I -	0
It's easier for the  person  but it's harder for the r- it	0
actually  less  informative for us because you can't enforce	0
any minimum level of specificity.	0
But I think that if you're going to have it be general	0
uh, so the idea again was, you know, you might wanna  also  know if -	1
if they grew up in Germany or if they grew up -	1
and so  uh, I think  you wanna -	1
The idea - the motivation I think for this being suggested  before  was that it did cover a range of these cases that might	1
you know, if you say your native	1
language was - was English but uh  you	1
you grew up in Germany, uh	1
Yeah, y- there  is  actu - you made me think about another wrinkle	1
in this whole thing, which is that  just asking them where they grew up	1
between certain ages isn't enough, because	1
somebody could grow up in Germany but live on an army base	0
Yeah.  Or someone could in Geor- in - in New York and have, I mean, any  number  of different types of  speech patterns.	0
Or their parents live - yeah.	0
Yeah, so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of -	0
Well, we have this - We hafta - So. He hasn't given you the  overview,	0
but you have, like, the  Native  Speaker category, the  Non-native  Speaker  category, and then you have	1
Other Language Influences, for example bilingual dialects, th- things like that.	1
Now there's this  issue  of	0
not wa- like  you're  saying,	0
you don't want the forms to be hugely complicated and take half the  meeting  to complete.	0
it's trying to - e- there's this - trying to - trying to hold this  balance  between the amount of information  needed  and	0
uh, you know, not taking too much  meeting  time, and then in addition, add to it the third level of the  balance,  uh, um this - this issue of not being too intrusive,	0
asking in a way that they don't mind.	0
If we  release  this corpus, what do we want, I mean	0
if you do this free form um  the free form solution where some questions are very open-ended	0
then you need - someone needs to enter that, and they'll be notes and it will be very difficult for somebody later actually use	0
Well, I think rea- I think that	1
that without mapping it. It's O_K. But it's -	1
we need to  remember  that we have -	1
First  of all, it's  not  all  free  form. We have several  categories that  are   specifically  constrained,	1
And in terms of the  more open ones, we have the - we're in the enviable position of having the  contact  information and also  knowing  most of the people who	1
will be participating in the meeting data. We can	0
find it - We can  resolve  certain issues later, if -	0
I mean, I guess what you  really  want, is if	0
Yeah, and the question is how	0
there's  some  information you wanna know - So we want some rough idea of their dialect, basically.	0
then we should have some question where it's not free form, except for these people who are	1
non-American English accents. There we probably have to have a category "Non-American English" and then a few choices.	1
And we should have something	1
that's simple, that people can circle,	1
these TIMIT regions or something, so that we have something	1
that minimally you can - cuz a lot of times if you give the data out that's what people are gonna use. They're gonna want some small set of	1
places, and then, but anything additional people can fill out, and we can put it in as a note or something, but if we don't have that, someone's gotta sit there and figure out	1
you know, I've got twenty people who said	1
Midwest, and I've got a few people who said something else and these don't overlap or these	1
Isn't it - I mean, I think  that	0
we're going a  little  bit in a  circle,	0
because I  like  [MASK] very much,	0
and I think it's a question of how to ge- incorporate it,	0
and - and we've already suggested - I mean,	0
it's come up in this discussion, that - the suggestion	0
we could have  um [MASK] for the American,	0
and - and then make the choice  or not,	0
Oh, O_K, so - yeah as long as you have -	0
as to whether we do it for British,	0
I mean, w- we sort of discussed one way or the other, and it	0
I don't know if  Adam has - has a preference,	0
but we could have  you know, a sub- a sub-categorization for American,	0
We could even use [MASK]. I don't know if it has one for British, or whatever,	0
But you know, just have it - you know, a short simple form that you can categorize yourself	0
in a - in a systematic way.	0
the - the phrasing that	0
Chuck used, uh  which was	0
in - in relation to the question I was trying to	0
where did you - what - what was that - what w- how did you phrase it?	0
What language was spoken in the home?	0
"What language was spok-", yeah, so it's not where did you grow up, but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of, what would it be, five and twelve or something like that?	0
Depends of who you  ask,  what the age range is.	0
Well, in the  home,  the influence of the  home  is much lower age than that, I mean once you go beyond the age five or six	0
the school influence as well and	0
and yeah, so  In the home it's sort of your phonetic first level,	0
Yeah, so this is why I -	0
So it's - you know it starts to get sort of complicated.	0
It's - that's  not  a  problem  though, I mean.	0
That would be a  good   question  to ask, and then you could add a question. You know,	0
cuz he does make a good point about the region not necessarily again, if you're on the army base or -	0
Well, the way it's phrased right now,	0
it's clearly asking about language.	0
And so, what it's trying to get at is what you think you  speak.  Now, I think that	0
the point is well  taken  that sometimes people are  wrong  about what they think they speak.	0
But, other than having a trained  linguist	0
interview them  and ask these very specific  questions,  I don't see a way  around  it.	0
Because as you  said,  what you're gonna have to stay - say is "Well, list the languages that your  parents  spoke when you were in home and how  good  they were at it and how long they spoke it,	1
and  now  list the ones in  preschool  and now  list  the ones in  first  grade and now list the ones your  friends  speak -"	1
Sort of like as soon as you get to the  cases on the edge, the complexity just shoots up.	0
So I want to  try  to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this  form	0
at the  beginning  of a  meeting  without taking f- uh forty-five minutes.	0
and then we - like I said, we have the enviable benefit of  knowing  most of these people.	0
and being able to ask them  follow-ups  if we need to.	0
For now, right so it's - I mean, again, we are hoping to expand this out, yeah.	0
So I think that adding the - the  TIMIT	0
categories  is a good idea, because that's very easy for a person to fill out.	0
But I think we  still  have this problem of	0
is it gonna be a  self-evaluation?	0
or are we gonna ask them	0
"what was it when you were  four  years old, or what was it when you were  six  years old, or what wher-" w-	0
What's the best way of phrasing the question?	0
Well, you know the  other  thing,  too,  is that	0
it seems like th- one of the reasons you would gather	0
real detailed information about their	0
native  language  is if you were gonna do [MASK]  or something.	0
Well that's what I was gonna ask, is that -	0
but most of those people don't rely on the self-evaluations, anyway. They'll probably listen to the speech, so	0
Well, I - you know, I w-	0
I  was thinking of it as -	0
but I was thinking uh, you know, with reference to	0
the  language model issue, which	0
and I  guess  it could be done  inductively,	0
but if you have a bunch of, say, [MASK] and	0
uh you know, if they -	0
But even you know in Switchboard, I -	0
I remember looking  really  carefully at -	0
They  have information sort of like [MASK] I don't know it's - how well they categorized,	0
but they had North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, and -	0
You know,  Texas  was definitely out on -	0
most of the people from cer- certain places in the South were	0
you had a huge range of -	0
You know, people would say Boston, and they had nothing like what I would call a Boston accent. So it was -	0
Were they putting down where they lived	0
at the moment they m- recordings were made? Is that why?	0
Rather than where they grew up?	0
No, the question was really	0
geared  towards trying to get people's self-evaluation of their	0
But you have a lot of  [MASK]  in -	0
and you know, for instance, you know, Minnesota Midwest is totally different than Michigan Midwest which is totally -  these were all settled by very different  type people, so	0
it - it's sort of a general help	0
but I think that anyone who's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that, they would probably use it as a first pass or something,	0
So, then we probably don't  need  the fine-grained information.	0
Well maybe should we just -	0
Then maybe we shouldn't - just shouldn't  ask.	0
Well, I think we  do  need to make sure about the f- the non-native accents because those are, you know -	0
but we don't need to ha- be really really specific about the others, because it won't be very w- helpful anyway.	0
Well, maybe for the native  English  speakers we shouldn't even  ask  the region if it's that  unreliable.	0
I think we  should,  because other databases do.	0
It's sort of a political thing.	0
And there are some general - like, you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category.	0
It  can't  be relied on  only.	0
The other thing also is that I'm asking for the variety of English, and I  did  just put American, British, Indian and other.	0
So, I didn't put Canadian, Australian, and all the other varieties.	0
But Other is there, and people will fill that out. They'll see by example.  Yeah that's - I think that's fine, they'll say oh, I'm not one of these, I'm	0
But do you think those three are O_K?	0
Yeah, I think those are good.	0
So internally, we have Texas and other.	0
So that for the Eng- native English speakers, we'll do variety of English,	0
regions from the TIMIT labels, and another field.	0
I mean, even like Cal- L_A is totally different than - I mean, you really can't um -	0
We could ask them for more information, but I don't think it's -	0
I  thought  this was  be fast.	0
necessary and it's not going to solve this problem.	0
the  final - the fin- the  third  category was designed to do,	1
because - I mean, you have a bunch of different types of accents in  New  York	1
You know. Native-speaking  New  Yorkers, as a - as a function of their  social  uh groups and their  ethnic  identifications and their -	1
You know. There are  lots  of things that are	1
which is why we have this third category. So	1
certainly distinguish American versus British,	1
and other types at that level,	1
and then allow people to self-identify if there are  other  specific things,	1
and then in  addition,  this issue of  regions	1
time  frame for the re- region because I think that if you live	1
you know, in childhood and as-  adolescence  -	1
if - if you - You know. So,  region  with respect to a  time  frame is what I would suggest.	1
"Where did you live?" I mean. What  you  said.	0
"where - where - wh- where did you live?", or	0
uh, what you were saying, "Languages in the home".	0
uh a time frame on the region would be useful instead of	0
It's a little bit  unbounded.	0
so  are  you suggesting that you put something in about childhood	0
well, you know, there's this issue of -	0
of what age is  relevant  for the formation of your speech patterns, whatever they are.	0
Well you could distinguish between pre-five and five t- five to twelve, right? So depending on what someone's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of  categories or whether - or whether you're talking more about their	0
linguistic speech patterns, you know	0
it depends how fine we wanna get, but we could say uh	0
"where did you live before you were five?", "where did you live after you were five?",  I  don't know.	0
I mean, I think the question on regions is really	1
how did they define their dialect region now, di- the- whether they picked it up	1
at - the - one age or another.	0
pretty much, I mean, most people will  know  whether they have a southern	0
um, but they may  have lived	0
you know, in other places, too. So if we ask the question about dialect regions, it makes  no  sense to say where do you live now.	0
You ask how would you best define your	0
your accent or your dialect style.	0
Right, the way - the way the form reads  now,  I think it's pretty  clear  that's what we're asking  cuz it says "Native English speakers, Variety of English, American, British, Indian, Other, Region".	0
And then we'll have  Southern  English, you know, whatever -	0
whatever t[MASK] are. So I think	0
i- if you  look at this fr-	0
Or you could say to somebody,  how  do you define your - your - the accent	0
And then you can ask these other questions as well, but what we don't want them to think is that they're living in a certain place	0
and that therefore they're - I mean, nowadays  hardly  anybody	0
from California  has a  native Californian accent, so.	0
Well I - I g-	0
I don't think it was  ever  the intent to  talk about the region  now,  because	0
Right, so I - it seems to me that  if you read this form,	0
O_K, as long as it's clear.	0
i- w- it's pretty obvious that it's a subcategory of the  language	0
that you think you speak,   not  where you  live.  I mean, I don't say  anything  about where you live	0
So it's just in the  section  talking about language.	0
Why don't we try it out.	0
and see -  see what kind of responses we get from people. Anyway.	0
And then uh, as Jane said, the last question is "List other language influences, bilingual dialects, et cetera." And that's just and open-ended	0
place for them to  do.	0
That's  to handle that  unusual  percent	0
And then the  bottom  of the form is for -	1
not  for  them  to fill out, but for  us  to fill out,	1
the aliases and database - speaker database that the person is in,	1
since we'll eventually anonymize and this will be a form- a place for us to	1
connect the two. And then the meetings that they attended,	1
because there'll be one form for each person.	0
Yeah, I guess I'll fiddle around  yet  again with the language stuff.	0
I  don't think you really have to do all that much.	0
It - it gets into a can of worms.	0
I mean, the more you ask, the more you realize that	0
you're not getting  great  answers to what you're  asking  and -	0
Well, y- you didn't really  talk  about the  non-English  speaker categories.	0
So, there's another area which is non-native English speakers which asks for Native language,	0
Region, and Variety of English.	0
Because it used to be that Germans would learn  British  English, and now I think there's, you know, is a certain percentage of them who -	0
What about proficiency in English? as well?	0
to tend toward American English.	0
Proficiency.  That's a good idea.	0
That's hard though, for self-identification -	0
You don't want to do it for political reasons, I mean - I'm no-	0
I wasn't thinking about that, I was just thinking, "Gee, I'd	0
like to know actually -"	0
No, no. I wasn't thinking political at  all.  I was just saying, looking at	0
applications of people over the years for post-docs here. They're r-	0
generally not very good at assessing their own abilities.	0
Well, do you think that's -	0
That's also because they know that	0
important  for them to be good at it. So, don't -	0
don't you think they overrate	0
Well, so maybe that's -	0
So, but no, I think proficiency is actually a good thing to  have  on this sort of form.	0
Maybe we - maybe we shouldn't  ask  it, I don't know.	0
The - the question are -	0
what are - what would the categories be?	0
I'd - I'd have to - I - I'd wanna relate it back to  training.  "How many years did you  study  English", or,	0
you know, "have you lived in the America - in a c- an English	0
country before". But it seems like that's  so  -	0
I mean, I think that	0
you know, if a person who -	0
What about something like "How comfortable are you	0
in a meeting conducted in English?", or "How easy is it for you?", or something like that where it's -	0
How - About "How long have you been	0
in an English speaking country?"	0
Yeah, that's a good one.	0
Something - wha- what do  you  think, what's it - I mean -	0
How - yeah? How long have you been in an English speaking country. O_K.	0
and it's also an i-	0
a good indicator. And there are people who  haven't  ever  lived in an English speaking country and who are  superb.  However,	0
And then there will be people who  live in an English speaking  country,  but all their meetings are held in another  language.	0
I do think it's a pretty good indicator.	0
some people who just don't  change  much in their -	0
Yeah, I'm - I don't know.	0
Yochai's company is like that.	0
Being totally monolingual, I'm not the right person to ask,	0
to talk about this but it just seems to me that that doesn't -	0
the length of time doesn't really get at what we're asking.	0
Right? It seems to be that  asking  about the  proficiency,  even if it's self-rated,	0
is  what we wanna know.	0
Except  that you have some many  biasing  factors, you have - you have people who are highly confident when they really  should be a little bit less confident, and then you have,	1
other people who are just the reverse, and - and it - so many things that vary - I -	0
And also we wanna keep it simple and non-evaluative.	0
Yeah. Oh, there's  another  form.	0
Shall we wait for other forms later, or you -	0
No, you got - what's the other form?	0
Keep going more  form  -	0
Uh, the other form is a modified  digits  form.	1
and  it's pretty sim- this one's pretty simple, it's - it's very much what like the digits forms in front of us, except it doesn't ha- ask for sex or native language.	1
Um, so it's Name, Email, Time, Date, Seat, Session,	1
Mike number, Channel, Mike type.	1
Why do we need  that  much information, why do we need the  email  address, for example?	0
Uh, in case people have the same name.	0
How often would that happen?	0
Yeah, I'm particularly sensitive to this cuz a good friend of mine in S- in Seattle was named Scott Smith and there were fourteen of them in -	0
We could  drop  email. I mean that's not a big deal, it's just uh -	0
Well, it's an - it's an interesting  identifier,  I -	0
I - now that I realize the und- the reason for it.	0
Well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time, someone's email could change.	0
Well, the other way I was thinking about it was assigning them an I_D	0
but I  hate  it when people do that to me, when they say, here's you I_D, don't forget it.	0
Oh yeah,  that's  bad.  Thanks	0
So, I - I wanted just  something  that would give us a  hint  of	0
who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it's a duplicate.	0
How about their birthday?  I don't know.	0
I mean, not - not the year  not the year  not the year but just their birthday.	0
It's the age question again.	0
Your mother's maiden name -	0
Oh, I see. Then, you don't hafta ask the  age.	0
I don't know, what are the chances of people having the same name.	0
Yeah, that's right. And a  bank  where you frequent.	0
Social - social  security  number.	0
So, although the email - email will change, I think that's a good way of doing it. We'll be able to backtrack from email.	0
I never thought of that as an identifier.	0
Um, and then the other thing I was  thinking  about	0
and it probably wouldn't be on the  digits  form, but it - it is something that	0
some  form  about  the individual meeting.	0
Now, the problem I  have  with that is I don't know who would be filling it out.	0
Well,  that  I think, someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact.	1
And this would - and - and we discussed this, this is with reference to like [MASK]	1
what you would put in [MASK] that's meeting-specific. So. And it could be something like,	1
the guy giving the presentation today	1
is the  student  of the professor who	1
So, speaker A is his professor and they - and he's preparing for his quals or some such thing like that.	1
Or it could be you know, "so-and-so and so-and-so are married".	1
Just to pick up an arbitrary an  example.	0
We - this wouldn't be relevant all the time but you know, if there's a big discussion on	0
you know, the - the - um, best way to move house,	0
then - and these people are talking a whole lot,	0
then it might be interesting information to say oh by the way they're married, or -	0
I - I don't mean, uh, you know.	0
So th- so the sorts of questions  I  had were one	0
Who's gonna fill it out, and who's gonna take  responsibility  for filling it out	0
in each meeting, I mean, will we re- will we  require  it.	0
I would tend to leave that	0
e- spontaneous, I think that	0
e- at the stage of uh	0
transcripts after they've been produced by -	0
At  that  point, I think that some of these dynamics will appear to be important, and you could - you could spend a  lot  of time enumerating all the different relationships that people have.	0
And that was my other question, which is  um	0
what  sort of information do we want to  record?  I mean, so I think  pairwise  relationships are pretty  easy.	0
You know, source, destination, relation.	0
Are there  other  sorts of things that might - we might want to record?	0
Well, I ju- I was just thinking, with reference to	1
uh, things that have - that bear on the content or the status relations,	1
would be the things -	1
Without  being  exhaustive,  by any means,	1
but just like I said, if there's a k- a certain topic that comes up in the meeting, and -	1
that knowing their relationship will clarify it,	1
or  if there's a certain dynamic that comes up -	1
So, I mean, a person	1
is asked a whole bunch of questions, more than you'd usually think they'd be asked, and it turns out it's because he's being prepared for a job interview or something like that,	1
then it's useful to know that - that relationship.	1
I think that fits in well with the whole meeting map -	0
But, not to be exhaustive.	0
mapping meetings concept is that's another way of  looking  at -	0
are there anything other than pairwise?	0
Oh, well  yeah,  you could have people who are all part of the same  football  league, or -	0
or  chess  club, or -	0
basically a notes column? I mean you can imagine wanting	0
you  should  be able  always  to attach some	0
notes to - is this the - the place where we would do that, or is there another	0
I've been thi- I - it seems to be that there  is  -	0
We could attach more structure if we wanted to. Especially because a  lot  of these relationships are pairwise power relationships.	0
I- Maybe I was missing something maybe, but	0
this is something one would try to  infer,  but how do - how would you	0
How would you freeze that information about what, uh, I mean, we already have these things about someone's a professor and someone's a student, or something, but	0
would you - would you -	0
Some person would be writing O_K this person was leading the meeting and that was or - or - is that what you mean, or -	0
What - what - what - uh,	0
Um, just as an  example,  it would be, "Source, Adam Janin", "Destination, Morgan", "Relationship, Advisor".	0
Oh, so you're just putting	0
I think that starts to -	0
There's definitely some clear cases,	0
but there are a lot of gray areas, where	0
just in that meeting, or, I mean, where you don't wanna sort of	0
make a distinction between a pre-existing	0
Well, realize, w- this was -	0
the idea  was  that this would be meeting specific.	0
it would be possible to have a	0
But I mean, there are some that generalize	0
Right, but that example was not -	0
over many meetings and there are some that don't, and there are some	0
Right, so my example was not a good one,	0
things that happen in between meetings,	0
So, I mean, for -	0
today,  for instance, this is the second meeting recorded today.	1
The first meeting was a - was a front-end meeting, and in that one, the basic form of that was uh, I was the leader,	1
and I was saying uh, "what are the results you've gotten in the last week?"	1
And they were - and uh one person was sort of taking the lead,	1
in describing what the results were,	1
and then uh, Chuck was taking the role of saying, "well, what did you mean by that?", so he was sort of like the out- s- semi-outsider, asking curiosity questions.	1
And then it would come back to me with saying "well, you know, you showed me  that  but you know, I think you should do  this  in the future,"	1
so it was very much sort of	1
"Leader" and - and - and - and "Led" sort of relationship.	1
the guy I was primarily doing this with uh is - is a visiting researcher,	1
uh, in this l- meeting,	1
uh, you are my graduate student,	1
but uh it's not taking that kind of role at all,	1
right? You're - you're - you're actually leading the meeting for the most part,  most  of this meeting, so it's -	1
Well, it's just cuz it's my turn.	0
Yeah, so I - I don't know, so you're suggesting -	0
I think this one needs to be open-ended,  completely  open-ended, and	0
the only concern  I  would have is if there's something we  wanna  be able to say and we can't put it in that field.	0
I - g- you -	0
You're  the expert on [MASK],	0
Well, [MASK] mean we can	0
But what I - what I was thinking uh -	1
the reason that I  didn't  want to make it  completely  open-ended is that it  does  seems like there  is  some  structure  which is common.	1
Especially with these  pairwise  ones, where you can describe them and pairwise. And you might want a  tool	1
So you mean like -	0
Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub-	0
I don't know what you would call them, but little labels	0
for things that we decide are useful things to have	0
You know, as long as we have this one	0
place where it can all be stored, then we're fine, I think.	0
Right, cuz it seems like it's sort of a -	0
and those'll probably occur - I mean, to us, we'll think of a few of them, some other researcher will think of	0
Exactly. It's sort of a research question, you - you're analyzing the meeting and you're deciding, "ah, there's this kind of structure to it."	0
Y- Yeah, it's - it's -	0
It's gonna change, and maybe we wanna regroup things under different labels later, if we figure out that these pairwise things are -	0
being - being in a common organization was one I hadn't thought of, that -	0
So you're  football  league was a good one.	0
So the  ones   I've  been thinking of are all sort of	0
I guess husband-wife is yet another one.	0
And so, you know, in discourse	0
analysis you get things like	0
You have - you have a  role  in relationships and it has to do with your negotiating your -	0
how you're perceived and how y- and how the other  @@  -	0
You know, and so there are  various  things you  negotiate.	0
And  I'm - I'm wondering if we  might  be able to do it s- in sort of a  loose  way, but	0
e- with - by having a searchable field like "role"	0
and then you know "within this context this person has the following roles",	0
and it could be very loose, but then it would be possible to	0
do something as simple as [MASK] across a database and if you're interested in	0
you know which - which - which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus	0
you know a l- uh s- uh	0
whatever, a leader, speaker, whatever,	0
you could just grep for "role"	0
you know, some - some particular  value.	0
So it sounds like having the facility is great, and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop  some of these categories that would be	0
generally useful and it - it sounds like a good thing to do.	0
And  systematize  also maybe the  encoding  of it if - as we find some are useful and some are not so useful.	0
Yeah, so what I have right now is all pairwise, so that's probably not sufficient.	0
I think you don't need to have that much structure built in, and that would	0
be less time-consuming to do it this way first, and then find out what structure's needed.	0
what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that - without this?	0
Will somebody go back and fill that  in,  or we just won't  have  it, or -	0
Well, I  think  that in a  lot  of the meetings people  won't  be filling this out  anyway.	0
So  really  what I want to have is a  place  that if a researcher  wants  that information, they can  add  it.	0
Almost all of the meetings	0
are recorded with roughly  this  group  uh and uh  you know and	0
a fair minority with the group that we have in the  morning,  so this is  not  a lot of people. We could easily - There's just a couple other meetings that	0
So it wouldn't be that hard to go back and -	0
We can regenerate a  lot  of this information.	0
generate it, I think it's alright to have some of the sections in your	0
that this information was  not  collected for this meeting.	0
And there's just not gonna be a way  around  that.	0
like the N_S_ A  meeting,	0
I don't think they're gonna want to fill  out  that information.	0
O_K, so we're running kind of late, so we'll probably wanna zip through some other things, maybe	0
do some more time on - on Jose's stuff later, um  uh [MASK]	0
Uh, I guess, you know, we - we recently woke up um our friends and uh	0
so I - I guess - you've sent off this - the uh	0
C_D-ROMs  and you got some response from -	0
from uh I_B_M about -	0
They haven't  received  them yet,	0
but I  did  get a  response  from them saying	0
"Yes we're still alive, we haven't done anything yet." basically.	0
Was there some suggestion that they might soon, or -	0
Yeah. So - so, they've	0
transferred the responsibility to someone else. I  can't remember his name	0
Something  like that, but uh -	0
And so he sent me email and said he's gonna be starting to work on it, and I haven't received anything else.	0
Great, O_K. Well, that was that one.	0
So  tomorrow  I'll send a email and just ask if he received it, he  should  be getting it today.	0
Actually he should have  gotten   it  yesterday.  But.	0
um, and I think we should just sort of look at this thing from you, off-line Jose cuz it's getting kind of late but I mean I think the bottom line just glancing through it is that there's - there's a  lot  of overlap,	0
in just  energy  related things and so you need something  else.	0
I mean, that's sort of -  right?	0
And uh what - the - so I'd -	0
What about that error that -	0
the supposed lub- no, the supposed  bug   that was -	1
that we were - We were guessing you had a bug before because  you went through and you concatenated all of these things together -	1
Ah, yeah yeah. I - I found the error,	0
and I repeated the experiments eh and here, eh  you can find the new results	0
eh  with - Yeah, yeah.	0
O_K, so this is post bug fix.  Good, O_K.	0
So um - so I had two thought just glancing through this. So, one is - one is that um	0
we might wanna talk about normalization.	0
I mean, I don't know what normalizations you use. Sometimes things have more overlap before you've done	0
some kind of normalization  and we might think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible.	0
And the other thing is that, if that  isn't   @@  uh so much of the issue, then probably -	0
I mean, [MASK] and just plain energy are very closely  related,  even though they're  different  and um so	0
um  you really  may  need to go to something that looks at i- in  some  sense harmonicity, or um	0
relationship to or - fit - fit to pitch tracks on uh - on either side of - of it, for instance?	0
You know, so if - if there's uh a really bad fit between	0
where the pitch is going in this suppose - uh hypothesized region of overlap,	0
and the - the - and one or the other uh side,	0
you know, then this - this - this might	0
an alteration in th- in the tracking way.	0
You mean that eh you ehm  mmm -	0
I understand that eh you - you mean eh to - to study the alteration	0
between the - the tracking of the pitch eh if we compare the overlapping zone with a speaker zone.	0
I- if you have two - if you have two - if you have  uh	0
in the co- in the  context.	0
there's an overlap, then - I mean the first thing is that there should be a mixture of harmonics	0
uh during overlapped voice sections anyway.	0
the - any - a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence,	0
it's also going to be a smaller  fraction.  This is, you know, related to the harmonicity sort of thing.	0
And then the other thing I'm saying is that if you look at the  temporal  evolution  of the pitch	0
there  should  be  something  like a discontinuity there.	0
Now, there's  other  places where you'll have discontinuities in pitch and speech, but -	1
but - maybe it'll have something to - have a different character.	1
But it seems like energy - energy tells you something, but uh	1
if - unless this is a normalization problem, it looks from your results like there's so much overlap that  certainly you need something that  isn't  energy-like, in  addition  to it, at least.	1
Are the things in the -	0
I don't normalicized eh in these er- experiments.	0
by the moment. I don't normalicize.	0
O_K, so the question is - is - would some kind of normalization  help.	0
You know, uh, i- i- it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall	0
um  energy uh for uh you know some - some longer period of time or something, uh  that - that there would be more of a distinction.	0
uh, I - I don't know.	0
are - hmm, I'm just trying to  remember  where we  were,  but uh, were - you were interested in finding out if you can tell the difference between  overlap and single speakers by looking at the e- energy, like say, for example, the mean of the energy. Was that the idea? O_K.	0
So, if you look at -	0
on this page that has uh frame energy, you look at the mean for the overlap, that's forty-four point sixty-two versus the mean for the speakers, thirty-nine point sixty-two, so there seems to be more energy when there's overlapping which	0
Which is the intuition, un- unfortunately there's a standard deviation of like ten, so	0
Yeah, different than standard deviation.	0
The  product of the  deviation is the vari- is the variance.	0
know the energy for a speaker when there's no overlap? I mean	0
I can imagine a model where you say, O_K, you know	0
I'm - I'm gonna give myself - it's cheating, but	0
and normalized for the speaker	0
not allowed. I mean, what's the -	0
Well, that's what I was suggesting, that y- you wanna do some kind of longer time normalization eh with the -	0
even if you make a mistake occasionally, that - that i- is roughly	0
corresponding to that  speaker,  so that if you, if - if uh -  if you	0
because that - that's gonna spread out these distributions really a lot, to  not  do any kind of normalization, and so that - that could mask the effect somewhat.	0
so the um - just one more clarifying question - On the overlap category,  is that	0
It doesn't include some of the other sounds?  O_K.	0
It's a pu- pure overlapping zone. I mean that eh overlapping between two, three, four eh eh speaker.	0
So that's why it doesn't add up down -	0
And did - is this from the mixed signal?	0
O_K, so there  is   some  normalization  already,  in that they've been  volume  equalized	0
uh over the entire signal.	0
That's what makes it  seem difficult, because you're already left with	0
Because they - they're -	0
a high standard deviation and they're already roughly	0
so that each person's  hearable,  right? - so- sort of equally loud, perceptually anyway.	0
What  about  doing it with just the single channels?	0
Well, I - I'm thinking - so	0
they're raising the question about the fact	0
if you use the  mixed  signal,	0
Yeah. I use the mixed signal	0
there's already been a -	0
Well, but the mixed signal already  has  a normalization in it.	0
Exactly.  So what I'm wondering is what about doing  some  of this with the	0
I - I don't study the single channel	0
is eh - is an idea.	0
Well, I think it'll be worse, right, I think the mixed -	0
to - to begin to work with the	0
eh  with the one- single channel. Now.	0
I have  another  - another thought.	0
Um, this is - this is  frame  energy, of course frame -	0
frames have a lot of	0
variance to them because different sounds	0
I mean, what if you took uh one second	0
chunks or something like that. Or - or	0
maybe not even a  second,  maybe a quarter of a second or something, so that you would typically have two or three basically syllable kind of length -	0
Yeah, like two hundred milliseconds or twenty to twenty-five frames, or	0
Or window it - hamming window.	0
So then you - you'll - you know -	0
So - so I mean, so you know two hundred, three hundred four hundred mill- some longer chunk of  time,	0
and then you looked at the amount of energy in  that.	0
and how does  that  vary over these different cases.	0
or  voiced  regions, I mean	0
can we tell? can we - sorry	0
I mean, is it  known  whether something's voiced here, or is it roughly estimate - estimateable?	0
Well, I mean, you could do a -	0
you could first determine that something was voiced or not.	0
I mean like if  one  speaker's voicing and the other one  isn't  and they're overlapping,	0
do we know that the first speaker's voicing, or not?	0
Well, I mean the overlaps are typically more than just a tiny little bit of time and so uh there could be voiced and non-voiced pieces during the overlap.	0
But will we be able t- to detect the voicing when there's overlap?	0
That's what  I just wondered.	0
So  if  we could, or if you  could  do  some  of it,	0
this - this has to do with these questions of [MASK] and so forth, right?	0
then um, voiced regions would be, like, probably more informative,	0
Right, so you could do something like, uh	0
and pi- and pitch for that matter.	0
But I think what will be easy for him to do would be to do this thing of looking over a large enough region of  time.  Cuz if you look over a large enough region of  time,   most  of the time you'll have some voiced -	1
a fair amount of voiced uh energy  in  it.	1
And so I think that would be -	0
And he has on his graph something like forty percent.	0
It looked like  fifty  percent or more are point two seconds or longer	0
It's li- I think the last page.	0
That'll  also lessen the  standard deviation.	0
Here in the - yeah it - it's a new -  new -	0
a new diapositive with information about the context for overlapping zone.	0
Nope, not the last page.	0
It was one of the tables.	0
Are you using a pitch detector in this  yet,  in your	0
Do you have a pitch detector that you're	0
do you have a - a  pitch  detector	0
eh, I - I'm - working now with pitch detector.	0
Well, it's the  fifth  page, I guess.	0
I'm working now, but eh I haven't eh results yet. But eh at this moment I - I - I prepare, I am - I am preparing the - the pitch eh eh tracking.	0
Oh,  it's seventy- five  percent!	0
pitch tracker eh algorithm that I have but eh	0
does it have a voiced, unvoiced uh	0
it just finds the pi- it just finds the pitch even when it's  unvoiced?	0
eh, I - I -	0
I mean, it must have some -	0
It  has  to  tell  you.	0
It  has  to tell you  something,  right?	0
It has to give you at least a zero, one, I mean uh d- binary -	0
It's  based   on uh a correlation	0
but eh I don't know what is ehm - eh -	0
because it's no my - my algorithm.	0
Yeah. So ordinarily in these things, it does tell you that it's -	0
it's voiced with a pitch of such-and-such.	0
And it will - i- i-	0
it will say something like zero or you know it'll have something that it says when it's - when it can't find a good -	0
good uh uh period, right? So it's looking for some periodic behavior, and if it can't find a period it tells you	0
for - for most things like that.	0
So I mean, this is, getting back to what Liz was suggesting which I think actually is good,	1
the more I think of it, that - that um	1
for normalization you could do something like take	1
voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in  that.	1
I'm just still going back to normalization, that even though it's  roughly  normalized, uh, for overall gain, I think it	1
it's - it - it may not be normalized enough.	1
For b- for both, for eh the frame energy and eh  residular  L_P_C eh energy	0
What kind of normalization?  I - I -	0
O_K, so - so I think	0
I mean,  @@  this is something to - to experimentally determine, but I mean,	0
u- as I understand it, you have - you have some	0
are marked, as - You have training data that you're trying to find a threshold, right? and so	0
all the things - all the uh	0
and uh look for the voiced	0
well, just in - in each case, take a - take a - take a frame,	0
if it's - if it's voiced,	0
Just separate out from the - from the normal things, separate out voiced.	0
Right? Then you're gonna end up	0
with uh a - a uh - a mean uh standard devia- deviation, and so forth. And then do your normalization based on  that.	0
And once you  do  that	0
You can also  look  at just the voiced regions	1
later. I mean, that would be the most sensitive measure.	1
you know, if you're normalizing for voiced, and then you look at regions that are voiced with the same robustness in estimation of what voicing is, um,	1
you should be much more sensitive to the -	1
to the overlaps then if you - you know if you  normalize  but you look everywhere at - at -	1
at fricatives or something you won't really know anything.	0
I mean assuming if it's  true  that the overlap regions are sort of	0
that there's some voicing in each of them, by each of the speakers, then you should do very well if you do this. But you'll only know that in the re- voiced regions but those are close enough to the -	0
You know, there's enough voicing going on and off uh that if you can capture the voicing	0
and if you can capture it when there's overlap	0
then you should do quite well	0
um if there - I suppose this is still just that one -	0
that one data sample, right, that one meeting?	0
it - it seems like a very hard test to have it be looking at the energy of all the speakers combined	1
taking s- you know, maybe two  extreme  speakers out of the mix and seeing if	1
if it's  promising  with respect to	1
that type of analysis. If you take like a target speaker, and  maybe	1
well, I mean, if there's enough data, maybe two -	0
two target speakers and then compare that to the mixture of all the speakers.	0
You could do that, yeah.	0
I mean, be - i- And if they still overlapped, i- i- the -	0
But - but I - I think that  this is a good first  thing,	0
to just sort of see.	0
And - and what this says is that - th- that	0
without  any special normalization at least, this is - there's a lot of overlap here.	0
coming back to Jose's  question,  I mean there's still this issue of - of - of how much time - I mean -	0
What do you look at in order to normalize? I mean, dur- you - you get some data in, you don't know which it is,	0
how do you - how do you -	0
W- w- what period of time do you look over to normalize it	0
that's - that's something to think about and experiment with.	0
harmonics would be very important.	0
So if you can find voiced regions and - You know,  if  you have two speakers and they're both voicing	0
unless they have very similar, you know, pitch, you should be able to see the  difference in harmonics pretty clearly	0
Right, so that's what we were talking about  before  with harmo- with [MASK] Yeah. So.	0
just by counting them, I mean  yeah, so even if you're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends because there's some  non-voiced regions, at least you can  have these islands of reliability where you're pretty sure.	0
the overlaps being fairly  long,	0
that  should  make it  easier.	0
That r- that was an  interesting   statistic.	0
and you could put an estimate - estimate, you know, a  fuzzy  start and end	0
That they're much  longer  than I expected.	0
But this is very short.	0
Ninety  percent of them are over	0
two m-  two  hundred  milliseconds.	0
Is a problem to detect.	0
Well, it's sort of  good,  though, if you're -   for - for your accuracy. Uh, Gives you a little more time to try to detect them.	0
It  is  good, but it's uh -	0
It's a problem to -	0
It's a problem to identify and to detect,  too,	0
with eh [MASK] for example.	0
What - what happened with the different contexts because eh  eh  you are talking about eh	1
the period or the - the duration of the - the window to eh the - the long	1
of the window to - to consider normalization  no?	1
But eh we have different contexts.	0
Yeah, and I - I -	0
The - the - the - the period - the - the - the length of the window to - to normalize eh the energy is eh in the context of the overlapping zone?	1
Is eh in the - in the  left context as in th- in the right context, considering eh the - these frames?	1
I - I wanna think about it and you should think about it. I - I - I didn't want to just pop out an answer because I realized I - I hadn't thought about it enough.	0
Two  hundred milliseconds,  hamming  window.	0
Because - because the - the - the problem is that we have different contexts.	0
Just out of curiosity, what was the bug?	0
What was the bug that you found?	0
The bug from last uh meeting?	0
The bug of - was the - [MASK] in C_.	1
because doesn't work uh when you eh -	1
you try to - to - to ass- n- n- to do an - a dated  access	1
to - to a file, a big file, eh eh moving the - the head of the - in the hard disk, eh e- forward and backward	1
a lot of time eh	1
and I had an problem.	0
Ah, that's interesting, and it didn't give you good  error  messages.	0
Yes, this is - this is -	0
I - I - I do the same in - in another - in another way and I haven't problem.	0
So it was positioning randomly?	0
[MASK] or whatever it is? I don't remember what it is.	0
One of the problems, if the file is  large,	0
um, and you're cast to the wrong  type.	0
I - I don't know, but uh I - I think the - the position in the file	0
eh eh in long file,	0
Well, what he's saying is that the typecasting could be the issue,	0
Right, if you're sending  at - an   integer  instead of a  long.	0
Yeah, cuz I think in - I mean, in general [MASK]  works,  so it's	0
I - I - I don't know	0
I don't know but eh I - I solved the problem with eh	0
a similar way and  I haven't problem	0
but eh I - I - I don't know because eh	0
eh it doesn't eh happen to me before.	0
I - I - I have the same codes in different parts,	0
and uh I - I had to - to - to change all - all the points in the - in the code,	0
eh to substitute eh for another way, but	0
Anyway, we're - we're missing snacks here, so uh -  let's - let's - let's - let's do our - let's do our digits and - and uh	0
O_K, we are going  off.	0
